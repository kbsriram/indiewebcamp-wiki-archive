= Facebook =
Facebook.com is a popular content hosting [[silo]] and activity [[aggregator]] most well known for being the largest centralized social network on the web.

== Exporting your data ==
You can export your data on Facebook by:
* Go to: https://www.facebook.com/settings
* click the "Download a copy" link at the bottom of the text

Alternatively, [http://www.freedom.io/ freedom.io] ([https://github.com/snarfed/freedom source]) can copy all of your posts, photos, checkins, etc. to [[WordPress]], [[Tumblr]], or [[Blogger]], creating a new blog post for each, with the original dates and all comments, etc. intact.

To export all photos in an album owned by others (such as all photos in which you are tagged):
* http://iangreenleaf.github.io/facebook_photos/

To export Facebook messages:
* http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/01/psa-back-up-your-shit/. This is complicated to set up and has some limitations.

== POSSE out to ==
{{main|POSSE to Facebook}}

There are multiple ways to [[POSSE]] out from your indieweb site to your Facebook profile.

Existing techniques:

=== from Twitter ===
* [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] POSSEs out from tantek.com to Twitter, and then uses the Twitter/FB integration functionality to cascade that POSSEing from Twitter to Facebook. Reasons:
** insufficient marginal utility in writing a custom POSSE syndicator to FB.
** FB just gets abbreviated summaries (thus placing more value on tantek.com original posts).
* [[User:Tommorris.org|tommorris]] does likewise, because he's lazy.

=== IFTTT ===
* [[User:Adactio.com|Adactio]] POSSEs out from adactio.com to Facebook using If This Then That (IFTTT).

=== Facebook API ===
{{main|POSSE to Facebook}}
Posting to one's wall is supported with the Facebook 'Graph API'. See [[POSSE to Facebook]] for details and examples.

== Post Types ==
(this section is a stub)

Facebook has a number of interesting [[post]] types, each with different appearances and interfaces. Some better than others.
=== Status Update ===
Status updates are [[notes]] similar to [[Twitter]] tweets, that, including status updates with links (see below) are perhaps the most common type of top-level post on FB.
=== Link ===
Links posts are essentially status updates, but they have a different presentation due to the [[link-preview]] that is shown for the first link mentioned in the update.
=== Photo ===
[[Photo]] posts are perhaps the second most popular type of top-level post on FB.
=== Event ===
{{main|event#Facebook}}
Facebook's [[event]] posts were quite clean and nicely designed, until they started rolling out a new design on 2014-02-27. Here is the design just before that point:

[[File:20140227-facebook-event-example.png]]
=== Comment ===
[[Comments]] are perhaps the overall most popular type of post, as people comment A LOT on other top-level posts, and Facebook has a two level notion of comment threading. That is, you can both comment on top-level posts, and comment on comments on top-level posts. The above event post screenshot demonstrates this two level commenting interface.

== Aggregator ==
Facebook performs the function of a feed aggregator of all your friends' activities.

Some examples screenshots can be found here:
* https://www.facebook.com/about/newsfeed

== Comments Embed ==
Facebook has a feature called '''[http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/ Comments Box]''' which "is a social plugin that enables user commenting on your site." Indieweb sites can use it to embed a [[comments]] box on blog [[posts]].

Though this does encourage your readers to sharecrop (on Facebook) their comments on your posts, it also provides them a single place to view their comments they've made across any/all sites that use Facebook for comments.

No indieweb community members are currently using this on their own sites.

IndieWeb community members that have tried this and their experience:
* Aaron Parecki:
** "Facebook tends to get more comments [than Disqus] for me probably because everyone has an account and is always logged in"[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-05-17#t1368819651]
** "eventually I decided the quality of comments I was getting wasn't high enough and I didn't actually care about peoples' random crap they were leaving on my site"[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-05-17#t1368819689]

== Activities Examples ==
* Alice shared Bob's status update.
* Alice shared Bob's photo.
* Alice likes Some Page.
* Alice likes a photo.
* Alice and 8 other friends wrote on Bob's timeline for his birthday.
* Alice added 3 new photos to the album Some Album.
* Alice updated her cover photo.
* Alice changed her profile picture.
* Alice commented on a link.
* Alice shared a link.
* Alice was tagged in Bob's photo.
* Alice played 10 sounds on SoundCloud.
* Alice added a job at Some Company to her timeline.
* Alice likes a photo on Instagram.
* Alice shared a story via Some Page.

== rel-me ==
Facebook does not currently support [[rel-me]] on their user profiles.

However, they do have a "website" field in the UI which you can set.

And then applications that wish to use that field for a one-off rel-me equivalence test can access that through their API:

* https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/user/

Careful parsing it, people often put multiple whitespace- or newline-separated urls.

== Criticism ==
=== Prefers Pageviews Over Efficient UX ===
Per the documentation in [[reader#Integrated_Activity_Reading]], one of Facebook's UI experiments involved an integrated reading experience that showed by posts and other "activities" in a single reading stream:

https://d23f6h5jpj26xu.cloudfront.net/gpnggaky8d1gog_small.jpg

What they found was that it was ''too'' efficient - users were reading things and not clicking to see additional pages.

Thus they abandoned the experiment, instead preferring a UI that generates more pageviews over a UI that is more efficient for users.

This may present an opportunity for IndieWeb [[UX]] to exceed [[silo]] UX.

=== Hyperlink Fear Interstitial ===

=== Harmful to Body Image ===
