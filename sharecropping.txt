'''<dfn>sharecropping</dfn>''' in the context of the IndieWeb is the practice of primarily or exclusively creating/publishing content on [[silos]] as opposed to doing so first (or primarily) on your own site.

The silos typically claim some degree (sometimes exclusive) ownership of what you create/contribute through lengthy/unfriendly terms of service (TOS) agreements (hence you're sharecropping on their content silo farm), and then display/sell ads on or beside your content (they profit from your labor).
