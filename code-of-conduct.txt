= Code of Conduct =
tl;dr: <blockquote>Be respectful of other people, respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered, and if you can't resolve an issue contact staff. If you are being a problem, it will be apparent and you'll be asked to leave.</blockquote>

Based on previous [[code-of-conduct-examples|excellent work by others]], this is a draft '''code of conduct''' for IndieWebCamp events.

== Respect ==
__TOC__
IndieWebCamp is an intentionally positive community that recognizes and celebrates the creativity and collaboration of independent creators (and independence) and the diversity of people, cultures, and opinions that they bring to IndieWebCamp.

IndieWebCamp events are an inclusive environment, based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender (including transgender status), sexual orientation, age, disability, nationality, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or software preferences.

We value respectful behavior above individual opinions.

Respectful behavior includes:
* Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
* Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
* If you're not sure, ask someone instead of assuming.

== Resolve Peacefully ==
We believe peer to peer discussions, feedback, corrections can help build a stronger, safer, and more welcoming community.

If you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to respectfully discourage them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful and welcome your input in doing so.

If you experience disrespectful behavior and feel in any way unable to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately bring it to the attention of an organizer. We want to hear from you about anything that you feel is disrespectful, threatening, or just icky in any way. We will listen and work to resolve the matter.

== Apologize for Mistakes ==
Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such, own up to your words and actions, and apologize accordingly. No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. What matters is how you handle them, and avoiding repeating them in the future.

== Consequences ==
If the organizers determine that an event participant is behaving disrespectfully, the organizers may take any action them deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion and exclusion from the event without warning or refund.

As organizers, we will seek to resolve conflicts peacefully and in a manner that is positive for the community. We can't foresee every situation however, and thus if in the organizers' judgment the best thing to do is to ask a disrespectful individual to leave, we will do so. We've never had to do so, please don't be the first.
