There are multiple ways to [[POSSE]] out from your indieweb site to your [[Facebook]] profile.

Existing techniques:

== Via Twitter ==
* [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] POSSEs out from tantek.com to [[Twitter]], and then uses the Twitter/FB integration functionality to cascade that POSSEing from Twitter to Facebook. Reasons:
** insufficient marginal utility in writing a custom POSSE syndicator to FB.
** FB just gets abbreviated summaries (thus placing more value on tantek.com original posts).
* [[User:Tommorris.org|tommorris]] does likewise, because he's lazy.

== Using IFTTT ==
* [[User:Adactio.com|Adactio]] POSSEs out from adactio.com to Facebook using If This Then That ([[IFTTT]]).

== Facebook API ==
Posting to one's wall is supported with the Facebook 'Graph API'.
* https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/user/feed/#publish

Programming language libraries for doing so:

* Ruby: [https://github.com/nov/fb_graph fb_graph] - see the [https://github.com/nov/fb_graph#update-status-wall-post feed!] method and [https://github.com/arsduo/koala/wiki/Graph-API Koala: Graph API] <code>put_wall_post</code> method.
* PHP: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/php/ and [http://www.yorkstreetlabs.com/blog/Publish-to-Your-Facebook-Pages-Wall-with-PHP: Graph API] - demo class also available for download.

=== See Original ===
Some indieweb sites (e.g. aaronparecki.com, kylewm.com) POSSE to FB and put in a "See Original" link in POSSE copies of posts there that link back to the original indieweb post! In addition, [[Bridgy]] looks for such "See Original" links as part of its [[original-post-discovery]] implementation. 

Each Facebook post [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/user/feed/#publish can include one custom "action"] with any title and link. The parameter "actions" is  a JSON-encoded map that contains a "name" entry ("See Original" in this case) and a "link" entry. Note: Bridgy currently only looks for custom actions named "See Original" (case-insensitive) when doing original-post-discovery.

=== IndieWeb Examples ===
In rough order of implementation:

==== Ben Werdmuller ====
[[User:werd.io|Ben Werdm√ºller]] uses [[idno]] on werd.io to post POSSE copies to Facebook since 2013-05-31. Example:
* Original: http://werd.io/2014/i-like-my-coffee-yak-like-my-soul
* Facebook copy: https://facebook.com/36802236_10100784559882869

==== Kyle Mahan ====
[[User:kylewm.com|Kyle Mahan]] uses [[Red Wind]] on kylewm.com to post POSSE copies to Facebook since [https://www.facebook.com/kyle.mahan/posts/10100804936358009 2014-02-18]. Examples:

* Facebook copy: https://www.facebook.com/kyle.mahan/posts/10100845623360929<br>[[File:kwm-facebook-copy.png|500px]]

* Original: http://kylewm.com/note/2014/04/05/2 (currently showing almost palindromically duplicate facebook likes)<br>[[File:kwm-fb-original.png|500px]]

==== Aaron Parecki ====
[[User:aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] uses [[p3k]] on aaronparecki.com to post POSSE copies to Facebook since 2014-02-20. On 2014-03-08 he started putting a see "See Original" link on POSSE Facebook copies.

==== Jeena Paradies ====
[[User:Jeena.net|Jeena Paradies]] uses a simple rails app on jeena.net to post POSSE copies to Facebook since at least 2014-02-20
* Facebook copy: https://www.facebook.com/jeenaparadies/posts/10152606923252678
** Note "See Original: ..." link inline in Facebook POSSE copy content.

== Brainstorming ==

== How we got here ==
Below are previous experimental examples of syndicating notes to Facebook.

These examples were created with the [https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/publishing/ Facebook Publishing API] using either the "message" or "link" parameter or both.

=== Note with inline citation link ===

Sent using only the "message" parameter, the citation link is part of the message.

=== Note with text and link parameter ===

Sent using both the "message" and "link" parameters. Facebook includes the note text, and creates an inline preview of the page, which shows the note text and the author's photo.

=== Link parameter only ===

Sent using only the "link" parameter. Facebook creates an inline preview of the page which shows the note text and the author's photo.

=== Note text only ===

Sending only the note text and does not include the citation link. This is not recommended.
