'''<dfn>archive</dfn>''' refers to date-grouped sets of indieweb site posts (a common form of [[navigation]] among posts), or a copy of a web page made at a particular point in time.

Longer: archives refer to:
* The [[archives]] of an indieweb site that allows you to [[navigate]] to past content by year and month, AKA personal historical archives, or
* A copy of a web page or site that can be used as a reference if the original disappears or is temporarily unavailable.
