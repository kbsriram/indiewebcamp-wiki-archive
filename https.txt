'''<dfn>HTTPS</dfn>''' is an abbreviation for '''Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure''', a protocol for secure communication, supported by web servers (like [[Apache]] & [[nginx]]) and browsers. HTTPS layers Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) on top of the SSL/TLS protocol.

There are two primary <span id="Types">types</span> of HTTPS:
* '''IP-based''' is the traditional way. SSL/TLS negotiation happens below HTTP, so the server needs to present a certificate before it knows which host the client is asking for. If the server has multiple certs, it chooses the appropriate one based on the IP address the client connected to.
* '''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication SNI]''' is a newer variant that can serve multiple certs from the same IP. Most modern browsers and libraries support it, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication#Support including OpenSSL 0.9.8] and up.

== How to ==
* [https://konklone.com/post/switch-to-https-now-for-free Switch to HTTPS now for free] outlines how to set up SSL on your personal site with [[StartSSL]] (note the guide primarily deals with using nginx as your server)

=== Buy ===
Buying SSL certificates
* [https://www.startssl.com/ startssl.com] offers free SSL certificates for single domains. If you verify your identity, they will also allow you to register free wildcard certs.
* [https://www.namecheap.com/ssl-certificates/comodo.aspx namecheap.com] offers single-domain SSL certificates for $7.95/year and wildcard certificates for $85/year
* GlobalSign offers [https://www.globalsign.com/ssl/ssl-open-source/ free wildcard certificates] (!) for open source projects.
* [https://ssls.com/ ssls.com] has inexpensive SSL certificates from multiple providers. As of 2014/03/08, a PositiveSSL certificate was $4.99/yr when buying 5 years. 
* ...

==== Validating Your Purchase ====
SSL Certificate providers require some form of verification of you, your domain, and your ownership of your domain.

'''CSR Generation — '''
A Certificate Signing Request must be generated at your site. For example, on a hosting provider that uses Cpanel, the "SSL/TLS Manager" has a "Certificate Signing Requests" section.

'''Approver Email — '''
[http://ssls.com/ ssls.com] asks for an "Approver Email" from a list of administration email addresses and Domain Registration email addresses. Choose one that you use, and receive the Domain Control Validation email, which contains a link and a "validation code". Click the link and enter the code to verify that you own the domain.

'''Certificate Email — " 
[http://ssls.com/ ssls.com send the certificate to the "Administrator Email" that you specified during the purchase process. This certificate is used in the process below.

=== Manage ===
When you're done with your purchase, you'll have one or more files for each certificate:
* The certificate itself, e.g. '''snarfed.org.ssl.crt'''.
* The private key you used to generate the certificate, e.g. '''id_rsa-2048'''.
* Optional: Your [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority CA]'s intermediate cert, e.g. '''sub.class1.server.ca.pem'''.
* Optional: Your CA's root, e.g. '''ca.pem'''. Hopefully you picked a CA whose root cert is distributed with most OSes/browsers; if so, you can ignore this. (If you didn't, you should reconsider!)

All of these files are usually [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509 X.509] format except the private key, which is RSA or other private key format.

Command line <code>openssl</code> is your friend for inspecting and editing certificates. For example, to dump info about a cert:

<pre>openssl x509 -text -in snarfed.org.ssl.crt</pre>

If your CA provided an intermediate cert, you'll need to provide it to your web server along with your own cert. For servers that only accept a single file, you'll need to concatenate the certs, e.g.:

<pre>cat snarfed.org.ssl.crt sub.class1.server.ca.pem > snarfed.org.unified.ssl.crt</pre>

As another example, it seems like this command line should verify that a cert is valid:

<pre>openssl verify -verbose -CAfile ca.pem snarfed.org.unified.ssl.crt</pre>

...but [[User:snarfed.org]] gets this error:

<pre>error 20 at 0 depth lookup:unable to get local issuer certificate</pre>

=== Setup ===
The IETF has a [document with recommendations for Secure Use of TLS and DTLS http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-uta-tls-bcp/?include_text=1].

==== Apache ====
[[Apache]] is pretty easy. [https://www.insecure.ws/2013/10/11/ssltls-configuration-for-apache-mod_ssl/ Here's a good how-to post.] TL;DR: Put the certificate files somewhere your Apache user can read, then set the <code>SSLCertificate*</code> config directives, e.g.:

<pre>
SSLCertificateKeyFile /home/ryan/.ssh/id_rsa-2048
SSLCertificateFile /home/ryan/www/snarfed.org.ssl.crt
SSLCertificateChainFile /home/ryan/www/sub.class1.server.ca.pem
</pre>

==== App Engine ====
If you're serving on [http://appengine.google.com/ Google App Engine]'s built-in <code>appspot.com</code> domain, you're already done! Just add <code>secure: always</code> (or <code>optional</code>) to the handler(s) in your <code>app.yaml</code> or other app config file, and you'll be able to access your app over https. [https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/appconfig#Python_app_yaml_Secure_URLs Details here.]

If you're using the java runtime on App Engine, add this stanza to your <code>web.xml</code> file.

 <nowiki>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<web-app 
   ...> 

  <security-constraint>
    <web-resource-collection>
      <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
    </web-resource-collection>
    <user-data-constraint>
      <transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>
    </user-data-constraint>
  </security-constraint>
</nowiki>

You may additionally want to send a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security HSTS header] to further improve security. In java, the easiest way from a servlet running on AppEngine is to add this header to all responses when running on the production server.

 <nowiki>
import com.google.appengine.api.utils.SystemProperty;

...

      if (SystemProperty.environment.value() ==
          SystemProperty.Environment.Value.Production) {
          // force ssl for six months.
          response.addHeader("Strict-Transport-Security", "max-age=15768000");
      }</nowiki>

If you also deliver static content, you may want to enable the HSTS header here as well. An example stanza within your <code>appengine-web.xml</code> file might look like this.

 <nowiki>
<appengine-web-app xmlns="http://appengine.google.com/ns/1.0">
...
    <static-files>
    <include path="/static/**" >
      <http-header name="Strict-Transport-Security" value="max-age=15768000"/>
...</nowiki>





If you're on a custom domain, you can use either SNI or a VIP. [https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/ssl Details here.] You'll need to [https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/ssl#uploading_and_configuring_certificates upload your SSL cert files] to the Google Apps control panel for your domain, then add and configure SNI or VIP slots in App Engine.

==== nginx ====
We can setup nginx to listen on port 443 with our SSL sertificate quite easily:

<pre>
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name example.org;

     ssl_certificate /path/to/unified.crt;
     ssl_certificate_key /path/to/my-private-decrypted.key;

     //usual nginx config here like location blocks
}
</pre>

For more detailed nginx config instructions see the page on [[nginx]]

=== Test ===
==== Production ====
[https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ Qualys's SSL Server Test] is an easy way to test the SSL cert on your live site. See e.g. [https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=www.brid.gy&s=74.125.198.121 brid.gy's report card], or for comparison [https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=jonnybarnes.net&hideResults=on jonnybarnes.net] gets slightly different results.

You can use <code>openssl s_client</code> to debug connection issues, e.g.:

<pre>openssl s_client -connect snarfed.org:443</pre>

If your server uses SNI, you'll need to provide the hostname too:

<pre>openssl s_client -servername www.brid.gy -connect www.brid.gy:443</pre>

Here's an example of debugging a single SSL issue:

* https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io/issues/14
* https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/20
* http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-01-04#t1388872084

Brand new StartSSL certificates may give an OCSP validation error for 6-24 hours after purchase. This seems to only affect Firefox and resolves itself when the certificate propagates to the validation server[https://forum.startcom.org/viewtopic.php?f=15&t=2654]. Firefox users can disable the check temporarily with Edit > Preferences > Advanced > Certificates > Validation, and uncheck "Use the Online Certificate Status Protocol"

==== Local ====
When developing a website locally, it may be useful to be able to test the site via https. For example, when writing an OAuth client, some providers will not redirect to a page that does not use https.

The easiest way to do this is to temporarily redirect your site to your own localhost (just for yourself) and use your site's cert. Just add a line like this to your hosts file:

<pre>127.0.0.1	snarfed.org</pre>

This is obviously temporary, though. For a more permanent setup, you can either generate a self-signed SSL certificate for your testing domain (localhost, etc) or you can create your own SSL certificate authority and sign the certificate with that.

To assist with this, [[User:aaronparecki.com|aaronpk]] has created an "IndieWebCamp" root authority that can sign certificates for domains ending in ".dev".

* https://ssl.pin13.net/indiewebcamp/

You can add a line to your hosts file for your test domain such as 

<pre>127.0.0.1   mydomain.dev</pre>

And then you can use the [https://ssl.pin13.net/indiewebcamp/ IndieWebCamp authority] to generate an SSL cert for it. There are instructions on the site for how to install it under [[Apache]] and [[nginx]].

== Why ==
Why?
* Tim Bray posted about serving his site via https (https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2012/12/02/HTTPS)
** "This blog isn’t terribly controversial. But if only the “controversial” stuff is private, then privacy is itself suspicious. Thus, privacy should be on by default."
** "Because I can; it’s the one small part of the Internet that I do have complete control of." (https://willnorris.com/2012/12/all-https-all-the-time)
* If you received a comment via an https website you can be more certain it's actually sent from the person
* Performance gains from using SPDY (https://thethemefoundry.com/blog/why-we-dont-use-a-cdn-spdy-ssl/)

== IndieMark Levels ==
Proposed [[IndieMark]] Levels of recommended support for HTTPS on your own website, as part of a security component

=== Level 1 security ===
Level 1 - "Don't do the wrong thing". (what's the minimal "not wrong thing"?). Possible reasonable behaviors:
* '''Refuse the connection''', because if you don't support SSL, generally you're not listening on port 443, so clients can't connect. Challenge: the user has no idea what is wrong, nor how to fix it (i.e. retry going to the site with "http:" instead).

'''Why?'''
* Avoid a misleading user experience.

'''IndieWeb Examples'''
* [[User:waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] on waterpigs.co.uk, if you try to [https://waterpigs.co.uk/ access via https], the browser shows something like: <blockquote>Unable to connect<br><br>Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at waterpigs.co.uk.</blockquote>
* ...


=== Level 2 security ===
Level 2 - support it for your admin pages with a self-signed certificate.
* E.g. How to make Wordpress use SSL: http://codex.wordpress.org/Administration_Over_SSL
Note: If you actually get a real SSL cert and serve your admin interface from the same domain, you are actually in Level 3.

'''Why?'''
* '''Security for write-access to your site!''' Otherwise anyone can hack your CMS and post stuff as you. (e.g. using a tool like Firesheep to sniff your login session cookies, and re-use them to gain access to your admin pages.)

'''IndieWeb Examples'''
* {{t}} for tantek.com on his [[Falcon]] admin interface at https://tantek.com/falcon/ [http://tantek.com/2014/143/t1/setup-self-signed-ssl-certificate-site-admin since 2014-05-23]
* ...


=== Level 3 security ===
Level 3 - provide your front-end over both http and https with a cert from a trusted CA

'''Why?'''
* You can link from [[silo]] profiles to your site via https
* You can start using (requiring!) your https URL for [[IndieAuth]] logins (e.g. into the wiki)
* Your readers can securely access your site without a scary warning message pop-up.
* [[privacy]] for your readers (what they are choosing to read)[http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2012/12/02/HTTPS]
* "Why not?" - GWG
* ... add 

'''IndieWeb Examples'''
* [[User:pauloppenheim.com|Paul Oppenheim]] on https://pauloppenheim.com/ (cert from dreamhost which uses comodo) since 2012-01.
* Tim Bray on https://www.tbray.org/ [http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2012/12/02/HTTPS since 2012-12-02].
* {{aaronpk}} on https://aaronparecki.com/ since 2013-11-10
* [[User:Dunlaps.net|Darius Dunlap]] on https://dunlaps.net/darius [https://dunlaps.net/darius/2014/03/25/indieweb-update/ since 2014-03-07] (at [[2014/SF|IndieWebCampSF]]).
** Level 2: previously, self-signed cert on his [[WordPress]] admin interface at https://dunlaps.net/darius/wp-login.php since YYYY-YY-YY.
* [[User:David.shanske.com|David Shanske]] on https://david.shanske.com/ since 2014-05-23.
* ... add yourself here with the date you reached level 3

=== Level 4 security ===
Level 4 - serve everything (home page, permalinks, images etc.) over https and send redirects from http -> https. I.e. your pages automatically get at least a lock icon in the browser address bar (and no warnings).

'''Why?'''
* All your site URLs will be consistent
* Avoid showing readers a warning message or triangle icon in the browser address bar
* Avoid mixed http/https content which is blocked by default on Firefox & Chrome. See: https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2013/05/16/mixed-content-blocking-in-firefox-aurora/, https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=81637

'''IndieWeb Examples in rough order of implementation'''
* 2014-??-?? [[User:snarfed.org|Ryan Barrett]] on https://snarfed.org/ (via HSTS header) 
* 2014-05-23 [[User:kartikprabhu.com|Kartik Prabhu]] on https://kartikprabhu.com/ (via 301 redirect)
* 2014-05-28 {{kylewm}} on https://kylewm.com (via 301 redirect)
** All new posts, resources, including external user pics.
** Caveat: There are some older posts with embedded images from http that still give the mixed content warning.

'''Check the browser's address bar''' where your URL is displayed and make sure:
# There's a lock icon before (in front of) the URL in the address bar
# There's no warning triangle icon (in front of) the URL in the address bar

'''FAQ:''' <br/>
'''How do you ensure that external content is over https?''' E.g. if I have an avatar for a comment from {{t}} it will be over http since he uses http.
* When you receive a webmention, download the image from the [[h-card]] and serve it from your own server.
* Unless it's a [[Twitter]] mention, in which case link to:
** <code><nowiki>https://twitter.com/username/profile_image</nowiki></code>
** See [[Twitter#Profile_Image_URLs]] for more on Twitter profile images.

'''Brainstorming:'''
* '''Move "get at least a lock icon" to a new "level 5"''' requirement/achievement, and bump existing level 5 to 6. Reasoning: it's much harder to serve all resources via https (e.g. external profile images), than just all your own HTML pages, and it's still greatly beneficial to serve at least all your HTML pages always with https.
** For now, since all existing Level 4 https examples all serve everything (including resources) using https and thus get the lock icon, no need to create another level until we have real world examples that would benefit.


=== Level 5 security ===
Level 5 - use correct ciphers, support forward secrecy, etc. per https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/ (all previous levels required, i.e. document method of http to https redirection)

'''Why?'''
* HTTPS is good, better with forward secrecy: http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2013/06/25/ssl-intercepted-today-decrypted-tomorrow.html
* Some ciphers are not safe, some are slower than others and SSL breaches are dangerous: https://hynek.me/articles/hardening-your-web-servers-ssl-ciphers/
