= Short URL domains =

This page is for documenting the domains that we pick out and use for our personal URL shortening, analysis of their reliability/dependability, and just overall experience.

== Why personal short URLs ==
=== Backlinks from syndication ===
A key part of owning your own content that you publish first yourself and syndicate elsewhere ([[POSSE]]) is providing backlinks ([[permalinks]]) to the originals from syndicated copies on social [[silos]]. 

Some silos have post length limits (e.g. [[Foursquare]] [[checkin]] notes are limited to 200 characters). Better to provide short URLs ([[permashortlinks]]) instead so you can syndicate more of your content.

Just like your content, your short URL shouldn't be sharecropped, thus you need your own personal short URL domain rather than using bitly or some other vulnerable shortlink service.

=== Permashortcitations ===
Permashortcitations are permashortids in the form of a classical parenthetical summary citation.

Short domains enable constructing of permashortcitations of the form:
* <samp>(example.me t1234)</samp>

This is particularly useful for providing less distracting citations. E.g. [[Twitter]] does not auto-link standalone ccTLD short-domains, thus making it possible to embed unlinked permashortcitations at the end of your [[notes]] which fit completely (including said permashortcitations) within Twitter's 140 character limit.

See also: [[Twitter#POSSE_entire_note_to_twitter|POSSE entire note to Twitter]]

=== Original post discovery ===
Both permashortlinks and permashortcitations themselves enable [[original-post-discovery]], for others to easily automatically find your original posts on your site purely from your syndicated tweet copies. Such automatic discovery in turn enables more indieweb-friendly reply-to behavior, whereby an indieweb user can write a post "[[in-reply-to]]" a tweet for example, and have their blogging system automatically post a [[rel-in-reply-to]] link to the original post instead (while still threading the POSSE'd copies together on Twitter).

=== Entry length limitations ===
Many systems either place absolute length limits on the text that can be entered into a field such a comment box, or have practical limits, that when exceeded lead to fragility, both of which provide incentive for shorter URLs, to allow more space for readable text.

Absolute length limitations:
* 200 characters: '''[[Foursquare]] / Swarm''' [[checkin]] "shouts" or "comments"
* 160 characters: '''<span id="Email_IM_SMS_print">[[SMS]]</span>'''
* ...
(Previously: '''[[Twitter]]''' has a 140 character length limit, but URLs posted to Twitter are t.co'd and thus count for exactly 22(23) characters for http(s) URLs no matter what the actual number of characters in the URL)

Practical length limitations:
* 70 characters: '''email''' - some systems wrap at 70 characters, thereby forceably truncating what of a link is auto-linked in a client, thus hyperlinking to a URL other than what the author wrote.

=== Easier to use ===
Short URLs also enable, and/or better encourage additional URL sharing scenarios where you are unable to either click the URL, or even copy and paste the URL, and instead have to type it in by hand:
* '''print''' - see http://tantek.com/w/ShortURLPrintExample
* '''[[Instagram]]''' - URLs in comments are *unlinked*, and in the "Native" iOS app, unselectable too! Thus if you see a URL in an Instagram comment, you have to explicitly type it into a browser (somewhere).

=== Additional Why Short URLs ===
For more on this, see: [http://tantek.com/w/Whistle#whyshortURLs why short URLs and why do you need your own].

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== aaron.pk ===

Short URLs at aaron.pk send a 302 redirect to a route at aaronparecki.com which expands it to the full post URL. This way there is no server-side code required on aaron.pk other than a web server that can send redirects.

Example:

<pre>http://aaron.pk/n4W8a
-> http://aaronparecki.com/-n4W81
-> http://aaronparecki.com/notes/2014/05/18/1/
-> http://aaronparecki.com/notes/2014/05/18/1/imessage
</pre>

=== jmb.so ===

The root domain jmb.so simply redirects to jonnybarnes.net. The only type of short URL set up so far is for notes. The URL scheme for notes used on jonnybarnes.net is very simple. They take the form jonnybarnes.net/note/{id} where {id} is a decimal number. The associated short URL is jmb.so/t/{nb60} where {nb60} is the [[NewBase60]] encoding of {id}.

=== cted.us ===

Redirects to colintedford.com; no shortener in place yet. Current URL structure is domain/year/month/daytime-slug (e.g. cted.us/2014/06/230157-my-url-structure), meant to eventually accommodate yearly & monthly archives and slugless redirecting to slugged. I want to use [[NewBase60]] & etc. to shorten the date to three digits as Tantek & others do and the hour & minute to a character each (e.g. cted.us/Wz8p2).

== Criticisms ==

* I’m indifferent about short URLs. it’s rare that I’ve felt I really need one, and for me the value doesn’t outweigh the pain of maintaining/paying for another domain, hosting, writing more code --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 14:05, 3 September 2013 (PDT)

== Domains ==
Alphabetically sorted domains:

=== gs ===
.gs is the [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/.gs ccTLD for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands].

There are no known content restrictions on .gs domains, and the [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/South_Georgia_and_the_South_Sandwich_Islands South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (SGSSI) is a British overseas territory], thus we can consider it as stable as .uk domains.

IndieWeb folks using .gs short URLs:
* Jason Grigsby: http://gri.gs/

=== gy ===
.gy is the [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/.gy ccTLD for Guyana].

IndieWeb uses of .gy short URLs:
* [[Bridgy]] proxy: http://brid.gy/

=== im ===
.im is the [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/.im ccTLD for the Isle of Man].

IndieWeb uses of .im short URLs:
* bear.im: [[Bear.im | Bear]]

Like .io, .im is rather expensive. The registrar is fairly easy to use but the number of resellars for .im are limited so people often use secondary nameserver services like FreeDNS to resolve their domain.

=== io ===
.io is the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.io ccTLD for British Indian Ocean Territory]

Experiences with .io?

.io is comparatively expensive ($39 on gandi.net at the time of writing), but easy to set up, and perhaps valuable as a novelty TLD for IndieWeb purposes because of IO's input/output double meaning. There are no known administrative problems establishing .io domains.

IndieWeb folks using .io short URLs:
* werd.io: Ben Werdmuller
* bret.io: Bret Comnes

=== ly ===
.ly is the [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/.ly ccTLD for Libya].

.ly domains are [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/.ly#Registration subject to content restrictions], including but not limited to "obscene and indecent names/phrases, including words of a sexual nature" and "may not contain words/phrases or abbreviations insulting religion or politics, or be related to gambling and lottery industry or be contrary to Libyan law or Islamic morality."

The [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Libya#Government_and_politics Libyan government is a dictatorship and "the most censored country in the Middle East and North Africa"]. In addition [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/2011_Libyan_civil_war Libya is an ongoing armed civil war].

There has been at least one case of a .ly domain name seizure / shutdown based on content restrictions:
* '''vb.ly was shut down 2010 September/October'''.
** 2010-10-06 [http://techyum.com/2010/10/official-vb-ly-link-shortener-seized-by-libyan-government/ Official: vb.ly Link Shortener Seized by Libyan Government]
** 2010-10-06 [http://benmetcalfe.com/blog/2010/10/the-ly-domain-space-to-be-considered-unsafe/ The .ly domain space to be considered unsafe]

For these reasons we recommend you AVOID USING ANY/ALL .LY domains.

=== me ===
.me is the [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/.me ccTLD for Montenegro].

There are no known content restrictions on .me domains, and the [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Montenegro#Government_and_politics government of Montenegro is a democracy].

.me domains can be registered through many major domain registrars. We suggest you get a recommendation from a friend.

Thus we consider .me domains to be reasonably stable.

IndieWeb folks using .me short URLs:
* Ben Ward: http://benward.me
* Tantek Çelik: http://ttk.me
* Will Norris: https://wjn.me
* ...

=== pk ===
.pk is the [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/.pk ccTLD for Pakistan]

There are no known content restrictions on .pk domains, and the [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Pakistan#Politics government of Pakistan is a democratic parliamentary federal republic].

.pk domains can be registered directly from [http://www.pknic.net.pk/ PKNIC] for $24 per year with a minimum registration of two years.

Updating the registrant info for a domain (transferring ownership, or even just updating the address or phone number of the same registrant) requires [http://pk6.pknic.net.pk/pk5/pgHelpUnlockDomain.PK sending a notarized letter] by mail to the registrar.

IndieWeb folks using .pk short URLs:
* Aaron Parecki: http://aaron.pk/

=== ro ===
.ro is the [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/.ro ccTLD for Romania]

There are no known content restrictions on .ro domains, and there are no registration restrictions for second-level domains. The .ro domains can be registered directly from [http://www.rotld.ro/engleza/index_en.html RoTLD] for $51.26, which is a one-time fee with no annual renewal fee.

Payment must be made by wire transfer or by faxing a copy of your credit card and photo ID to the registrar.

IndieWeb folks using .ro short URLs:
* Amber Case, for her Cyborg Anthropology website: http://anth.ro/
** As of 2013-09, [[2013/UK/Demos#Amber|recommends against getting a .ro domain]]

=== tc ===
.tc is the [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/.tc ccTLD for the Turks and Caicos Islands.]

This TLD is going through pricing turmoil, raising prices from $50 to $120 per year in some cases.  The new manager of the registrar, [http://meridiantld.net/pricing/ Meridian TLD], is offering current domain owners a domain transfer and a year renewal for $44 USD, effectively forcing domain owners to change registrars.  More information on this racket can be found on the [https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2012/08/3-easy-steps-to-ruin-the-reputation-of-a-countrys-domain-extension.html iwantmyname.com blog].

IndieWeb folks using .tc short URLs:
* <strike>Bret:  http://bre.tc - I do not recommend this tld.  It has been nothing but pain and agony.</strike> using .io now.

=== uk ===
.uk is the [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/.uk ccTLD for the United Kingdom.]

Originally Nominet UK only allowed domains to be registered under certain subdomains, such as co.uk or org.uk. They have recently opened up the top-level domain itself. There is a potential difficulty in registering short domains though as people who have already registered the .co.uk variant get priority I believe.

'''Note''' The registrar requires that your WHOIS mailing address be a valid UK address, for details see [http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/registering-uk-domain/choosing-domain-name/rules section 7].
