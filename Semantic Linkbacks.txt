'''<dfn>[https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-semantic-linkbacks Semantic Linkbacks]</dfn>''' is a [[WordPress]] plugin that upgrades the presentation of linkback notifications (like Trackback, Pingback, or Webmention*) from the ugly default pingback presentation of <samp>"[…] random text excerpt […]"</samp> to a much more meaningful and user-friendly display as [[comments]], [[reposts]], [[likes]], and [[favorites]], detected using [[microformats2]] markup from the source of the linkback.

For explicit [[in-reply-to]] [[interactions]], the plugin also changes the WordPress comment type from "<code>webmention</code>" to "<code>comment</code>". Otherwise, it creates human readable whole sentences like "Alice liked this article on alice.example.com." with hyperlinks to the source author and permalink.

== Comment Type Indicator ==
For [[in-reply-to]] interactions, the plugin adds a "type" indicator in the comment metadata for the specific type of interaction:
* [[reply]]
* [[repost]]
* [[like]]
* [[favorite]]
* [[rsvp]]
* [[mention]] - Defaults to mention if another type cannot be determined, e.g. "Alice mentioned this article on alice.example.com."

This "type" indicator enables further interaction-specific presentation customization, such as showing likes/favorites and/or reposts as a [[facepile]].

== Related Plugins ==
=== Webmention Plugin ===
<nowiki>*</nowiki>WordPress supports Pingback and Trackback by default; for Webmention support, you must install the separate [[Webmention Plugin]] which is very nicely complementary to the [[Semantic Linkbacks]] plugin.
=== Semantic Comments ===
The [https://github.com/dshanske/semantic-comments Semantic Comments] plugin is an attempt by {{gwg}} to use the type indicator to display mentions as a [[facepile]]. The plugin works, but redevelopment is ongoing.
