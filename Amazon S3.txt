Leonardo Zangrando hosts his website on S3.

These are the notes that I took while cerating my S3 Jekyll Indieweb site.

* Create account AWS
* Create account AS3 in AWS
* Create bucket in AS3 and initialise Cloudfront for website delivery via AWS - instructions here https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website#how-to-use-cloudfront-to-deliver-your-blog
* Install Jekyll on local - instructions here http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/
* Write a post and commit (?) -  from terminal, in blog local folder type command  $ jekyll build
* Upload blog to ASW - in terminal in blog local folder type command  $ s3_website push
