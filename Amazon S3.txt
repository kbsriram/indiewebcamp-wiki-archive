'''<dfn>Amazon S3</dfn>''' is a file hosting service from Amazon.

Leonardo Zangrando hosts his website on S3.

These are the notes that I took while cerating my S3 Jekyll Indieweb site.

* Create account AWS
* Create account AS3 in AWS
* Create bucket in AS3 and initialise Cloudfront for website delivery via AWS - instructions here https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website#how-to-use-cloudfront-to-deliver-your-blog
* Install Jekyll on local - instructions here http://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/
* Write a post and commit (?) -  from terminal, in blog local folder type command  $ jekyll build
* Upload blog to ASW - in terminal in blog local folder type command  $ s3_website push

Other sources
* Other instructions for deployment on GitHub here http://jekyllbootstrap.com/ - not tried
* for tutorial check also http://www.andrewmunsell.com/tutorials/jekyll-by-example/#why-jekyll - used to install jekyll on aws s3, but now apparently the tutorial is $15 :(
* check also blogging framework http://octopress.org/ - installed a GitHub version, but still not working, site doesn't build (dunno why)
* http://yeswejekyll.com/ very intersting, with links to different templates by http://foundation.zurb.com/

== Considerations ==

* If your site has modest traffic then you will have a low hosting bill. There is no minimum cost per month.
* Amazon is responsible for keeping the hardware and software running, and Amazon probably has more resources for fixing problems than you do :-)
* Content on S3 is stored redundantly.
* It is very difficult to serve custom HTTP status codes (e.g. 301 redirects): you must create a dummy file at the appropriate URL and then use Amazonâ€™s web-based management system to set up the status.
* It is not possible to perform advanced URL rewriting on the server.
* You cannot run your own software (e.g. PHP or Perl scripts) server-side.
