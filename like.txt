'''<dfn>like</dfn>''' is a popular [[webaction]] button and in some cases [[post]] type on various [[silos]] such as [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]]. It is similar to but different from a [[favorite]].

== How ==
To post a "like", the post's [[h-entry]] MUST hyperlink to the permalink of the thing that is being liked, with <code>class="u-like-of"</code>. E.g.
<pre><nowiki>
<span class="h-entry"> ... 
 <a class="u-like-of" href="http://someothersite.example.com/permalink47">...</a>
</span>
</nowiki></pre>
Demonstrates an h-entry for a "like" of <nowiki>http://someothersite.example.com/permalink47</nowiki>.

The trailing preposition "of" helps communicate this in the same that we have <code>u-in-reply-to</code> instead of <code>u-reply</code>. 

=== Previously ===
Previously the class "u-like" was used, but "u-like-of" is better.
 
Advantages of u-like-of over u-like for this purpose:
* '''Reads better''' <blockquote>it reads better, more consistently with in-reply-to, e.g. “this post is in-reply-to that post”, “this post is a like-of that post” — Barnaby Walters</blockquote><blockquote>KartikPrabhu supports like-of for ease of reading specially easy for beginners</blockquote>
* '''Frees up u-like for linking to permalinks of likes'''. This frees up "u-like" (and "p-like") to actually indicate that the URL being linked is a like itself (e.g. similar to "p-comment").

=== Sandeep ===
[[User:Sandeep.io|Sandeep Shetty]] has started posting "like" [[posts]] on his own site with a different presentation than other post types, e.g.:

* http://www.sandeep.io/40
** is a "like" of http://aaronparecki.com/notes/2013/06/09/1/jawboneup-fuelband-qs

In some ways this resembles a [[quote]] post (e.g. like on [[Tumblr]]) but the presentation is different enough (usually quote posts are either *only* the quote, or if the quote is entirety, it might just be a [[repost]]).

=== Ben Werdmuller ===
Ben Werdmuller as of IndieWebCamp [[2013]] implemented likes on werd.io, but called them favorites (because he preferred the term, though they behave like likes).

Example:
* http://werd.io/view/51d1fd3dbed7de817a526da2
** Is a like of: http://tantek.com/2013/182/t2/publish-elsewhere-syndicate-silo-pesetas-indieweb

=== Brid.gy ===
As of the end of 2013, [[Bridgy]] now sends webmentions for Facebook and Twitter likes, Twitter favorites, and Google+ +1s. It uses <code>class="u-like u-like-of"</code> to support both the original property and the counterproposal above.

== Discussion ==
Facebook seems to differentiate between likes of posts and likes of pages. This seems like an important semantic difference. Is the indieweb equivalent of liking a page a [[favourite]]? - [[user:acegiak.net]]
