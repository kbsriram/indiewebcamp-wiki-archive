* [[reply]]
* [[repost]]
* [[like]] / [[favorite]] or other [[reaction]]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* see the lists on each of the interactions for now.

== Alternatives ==
Various alternatives and opinions, nuances, experiences with use thereof.

The goal of this section is to get rough consensus around what to call the set of things that is replies/comments, reposts/reshares, likes/favorites.[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-07-30#t1406780480]

=== Interactions ===
'''<dfn>interactions</dfn>''' is a more recent term being used for the set of things that people do to blog posts.

If you have opinions or experience with using the term '''interactions'', please add them here:

* +1 {{t}}: I've used the term "interactions" successfully in talks (e.g. [[2014/PDF]]) to describe all the things people do to blog posts, on the blog post directly, and indirectly via [[POSSE]] copies, which then get [[bridgy]]/[[webmention]] aggregated back to the original. 
* +1 {{benwerd}}: (from Ben in person at [[events/2014-07-30-hwc]], he's used the term interactions successfully when explaining to both technical and non-technical people about the set of things from other people below a blog post)
* +1 {{shanehudson}}: "I definitely prefer interactions, it gives the widest scope"[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-07-30#t1406781706]. Since writing that on IRC, I have started implementing interactions on the new version of my site, I previously just hooked webmentions into 'comments'.

=== Responses ===
'''<dfn>responses</dfn>''' is the term used on some of the earliest work on clustering replies/reposts/likes was done by Sandeep Shetty on the (now out of date and a bit messy) [[responses]] page.

If you have opinions or experience with using the term '''responses'', please add them here:

*  +1 Sandeep Shetty: (presumed, as originator of the [[responses]] page).
* -1 {{t}}: sounds too much like just a synonym for "replies"[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-07-26#t1406396458], and thus not sufficiently inclusive of the lighter-weight things like reposts/likes/bookmarkings etc. It also sounds a bit too programmer/dev-centric, e.g. HTTP responses.
* +0 {{gregor}}: "Why is the synonymy of responses and replies problematic?"[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-07-26#t1406398212]
* +1 {{gwg}}: I like responses, but I saw some of the debate ... I bow to the will of the group.[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-07-30#t1406780517]
* +1 {{jonpincus}}: i asked people on The Tapestries, and they preferred "responses" to "interactions". [we already use "reactions" to mean "likes, favorites, agree, disagree, etc." -- that is, responses that aren't replies][http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-07-31#t1406823207]
* +1 [[User:Snarfed.org|Ryan]]: [[Bridgy]] and Ryan's own [https://snarfed.org/responses snarfed.org/responses] both use "responses." Ryan doesn't care which term "wins," but "response" is pretty baked into Bridgy, and he probably wouldn't prioritize changing it anytime soon.

=== Reactions ===
'''<dfn>reactions</dfn>''' is another umbrella term for replies/reposts/likes, and has some history.

[[Technorati]] used to call the full set of things linking to blog posts "reactions"[https://twitter.com/technorati/status/6974758539], mostly because it was difficult to tell the difference between an actual reply/comment, an offhand mention, a quote, or some other citation. So "reactions" came to mean the set of things which link back to blog posts.

If you have opinions or experience with using the term '''responses'', please add them here:

* +0 {{t}}: "reactions" now sound almost impulsive rather than thoughtful, and thus may make sense as a grouping term for lighter-weight things like reposts/likes/bookmarkings, exclusive of actual written replies/commentary.
