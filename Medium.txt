=== IndieWeb Examples ===
==== Shane Becker ====
Shane Becker is manually POSSEing his articles to Medium [http://iamshane.com/articles/2013/8/8/1/json-ld-is-an-uneeded-spec since at least 2013-08-08] (maybe longer) e.g.:
* http://iamshane.com/articles/2013/8/8/1/json-ld-is-an-uneeded-spec
** POSSE copy: https://medium.com/indieweb-thoughts/70d1ab49bfbb

{{kevinmarks}} is manually POSSEing his articles to Medium [https://medium.com/@kevinmarks/fragmentions-41ef2be9953f since 2014-04-21], e.g.:
* http://www.kevinmarks.com/fragmentions.html (2014-04-17)
** POSSE copy: https://medium.com/@kevinmarks/fragmentions-41ef2be9953f

== Criticism ==
* 2010-07-10 http://iamshane.com/articles/2010/11/7/1/no-more-sharecropping
** POSSEd to Medium: https://medium.com/indieweb-thoughts/9d0e36524dbf
* https://medium.com/surveillance-state/19a5db211e47 (currently 404s - anyone have an archive?)
* 2013-07-08 <cite>The Problem With Medium: A Shiny Content Farm is Still a Content Farm</cite> https://medium.com/writers-on-writing/336300490cbb
* 2013-07-10 https://twitter.com/t/status/355069622325747713
* 2014-05-30 [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-30/line/1401478311 Medium doesn't support footnotes]
* 2014-06-09 Medium does not appear to show the full published date in the visible content. Instead there is a [[The-Open-Graph-protocol|Open Graph Protocol]] meta element: <code>meta property="article:published_time" content="2014-01-16T08:59:18.300Z"</code>
** Example: https://medium.com/binary-times/use-your-own-product-or-die-ba3e2d738a55
** It appears that the year is displayed depending how recent the article is. A 2013 article linked above includes the year in the visible content, but as of this writing (2014-06), the example link only shows "Jan 16," because it is recently published, in the current year.
* 2014-07-23 Medium rolls out [https://medium.com/the-story/new-editor-features-title-images-and-more-5588495ec3c0 New Editor Features], marginalia comments are full of disappointment and criticism
** "We wanted to be writers. you made us into designers." [https://medium.com/the-story/new-editor-features-title-images-and-more-5588495ec3c0#1e9e-1fcb08f06651]
