<dfn><span class="h-card">[http://kylewm.com Kyle Mahan]</span></dfn> is a software developer in the SF bay area. I'm working on a Python/Flask based micro-blogging engine [[Red Wind]] that supports POSSE to Facebook and Twitter, sends and receives webmentions, sends PuSH notifications, and backfeeds comments and replies from silos thanks to Bridgy.

== Itches ==

=== personal site ===
* PESOS button to import a one-off tweet
** or even automatically grab all recent tweets that aren't represented yet
* send webmention when comments are deleted
* commit file store in git automatically, possibly delayed
* Ability to be able to add new post-types (e.g., "bookmark") without changing code. Possibly call the thing that is the first part of the URL path the "category".
* Split out admin templates and "theme" templates
* Collection posts for photo albums -- prompted by batch of vacation photos starting around https://kylewm.com/photo/2014/07/31/4
** added album selector for POSSE to Facebook; album should exist on my site too! 
* Android application that uses web intents to share photos or links to my site (use micropub?)
* Consume/PESOS from last.fm API somehow. Low bandwidth option: grab and publish [http://www.last.fm/api/show/user.getWeeklyArtistChart top artists] and [http://www.last.fm/api/show/user.getWeeklyTrackChart top tracks] once a week  
* "reposts" of longer-than-tweet-length content need more sophistication. e.g. [http://ryandc.tumblr.com/post/37252937055/adam-brault-i-quit-twitter-for-a-month-and-it a tumblr repost of an indieweb post]
** auto-fill or fallback to the mf2util generated content, but let me override manually with a different title/summary.
** do the same with bookmarks and likes?

==== Done ====
* post notes and syndicate to twitter from the main page, fewer clicks
* define path to theme templates in a config file

=== generation 2 ===

''tbh, I've lost interest in all this'' [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]] 22:21, 3 August 2014 (PDT)

How can I help onboard tech-savvy non-developers (or developers who don't want to be a sysadmin). php is pretty well covered, thinking about alternatives.

* Right now static site generators; still very technical, but easy to host.[https://kylewm.com/note/2014/06/20/2]
* Small kernel of dynamic behavior (e.g., receive webmentions, save to file store, push to git, triggering a rebuild). Doesn't have to be fast -- this could be offloaded to a free heroku instance that could serve several different sites (like webmention.herokuapp.com).
* Ideally would be static-generator-agnostic

=== other ideas ===

* Browser plugin to display a status icon if the current site accepts webmentions and/or pingbacks. Clicking could bring up more detailed information: h-feed, microformats2, microformats1, etc. [https://kylewm.com/reply/2014/06/06/1] 
* In the Bridgy mould, would it be useful to extract webmention sending as a separate service that could watch an h-feed and send mentions for links in new entries? PuSH consuming and monitoring for updates/deletes would be a little tricky.
* This is fuzzier. It would be cool to have a proxy server that could generate h-entry's from "arbitrary" sources: e.g., silos that are already supported by a-u, tumblr, blogger, wordpress, NYT, Wapo, LATimes. Useful for fetching reply context, maybe other stuff. 
* micropub post-authoring tool, like Prose.io is to github pages. 
* Figure out an email situation somewhere between self-hosting postfix/dovecot and abandoning all hope to Gmail.
