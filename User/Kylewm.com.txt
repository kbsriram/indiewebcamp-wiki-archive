<dfn><span class="h-card">[http://kylewm.com Kyle Mahan]</span></dfn> is a software developer in the SF bay area. I'm working on a Python/Flask based micro-blogging engine [[Red Wind]] that supports POSSE to Facebook and Twitter, sends and receives webmentions, sends PuSH notifications, and backfeeds comments and replies from silos thanks to Bridgy.

== Itches ==

=== personal site ===
* send webmention when comments are deleted
* commit file store in git automatically, possibly delayed
* Ability to be able to add new post-types (e.g., "bookmark") without changing code. Possibly call the thing that is the first part of the URL path the "category".
* post notes and syndicate to twitter from the main page, fewer clicks
* split out admin templates and "theme" templates
** define path to theme templates in a config file
* add form to send micropub comments and likes if visitor is logged in and supports Î¼pub
* (re)design ... want something lightweight but less boring/white (looked at html5up.net, pretty but heavy)

=== generation 2 ===

How can I help onboard tech-savvy non-developers (or developers who don't want to be a sysadmin). php is pretty well covered, thinking about alternatives.

* Right now static site generators; still very technical, but easy to host.[https://kylewm.com/note/2014/06/20/2]
* Small kernel of dynamic behavior (e.g., receive webmentions, save to file store, push to git, triggering a rebuild). Doesn't have to be fast -- this could be offloaded to a free heroku instance that could serve several different sites (like webmention.herokuapp.com).
* Ideally would be static-generator-agnostic

=== other ideas ===

* Browser plugin to display a status icon if the current site accepts webmentions and/or pingbacks. Clicking could bring up more detailed information: h-feed, microformats2, microformats1, etc. [https://kylewm.com/reply/2014/06/06/1] 
* In the Bridgy mould, would it be useful to extract webmention sending as a separate service that could watch an h-feed and send mentions for links in new entries? PuSH consuming and monitoring for updates/deletes would be a little tricky.
* This is fuzzier. It would be cool to have a proxy server that could generate h-entry's from "arbitrary" sources: e.g., silos that are already supported by a-u, tumblr, blogger, wordpress, NYT, Wapo, LATimes. Useful for fetching reply context, maybe other stuff. 
* micropub post-authoring tool, like Prose.io is to github pages. 
* Figure out an email situation somewhere between self-hosting postfix/dovecot and abandoning all hope to Gmail.
