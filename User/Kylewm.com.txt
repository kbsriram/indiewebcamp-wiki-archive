<dfn><span class="h-card">[http://kylewm.com Kyle Mahan]</span></dfn> is a software developer in the SF bay area. I'm working on a Python/Flask based micro-blogging engine [[Red Wind]] that supports POSSE to Facebook and Twitter, sends and receives webmentions, sends PuSH notifications, and backfeeds comments and replies from silos thanks to Bridgy.

== Itches ==

=== personal site ===

* Mixed-content warning for images reposted from http (e.g. twitter). Could mirror locally or serve over an https proxy.
* I'm itchy about mixing long-form articles with (in my case very ephemeral) notes. Red Wind UX is geared to quick notes atm. 
** For articles I prefer the static site generator flow of writing in a text editor.
* Improve post metadata styling. grey links at the bottom of each post are too cluttered and too click targets are too small.
* Split out admin templates and "theme" templates, better support for customization across installs
* Collection posts for photo albums -- prompted by batch of vacation photos starting around https://kylewm.com/photo/2014/07/31/4
** added album selector for POSSE to Facebook; album should exist on my site too! 
* Consume/PESOS from last.fm API somehow. Low bandwidth option: grab and publish [http://www.last.fm/api/show/user.getWeeklyArtistChart top artists] and [http://www.last.fm/api/show/user.getWeeklyTrackChart top tracks] once a week  
* "reposts" of longer-than-tweet-length content need more sophistication. e.g. [http://ryandc.tumblr.com/post/37252937055/adam-brault-i-quit-twitter-for-a-month-and-it a tumblr repost of an indieweb post]
** auto-fill or fallback to the mf2util generated content, but let me override manually with a different title/summary.
** do the same with bookmarks and likes?

=== other ideas ===

* Browser plugin to display a status icon if the current site accepts webmentions and/or pingbacks. Clicking could bring up more detailed information: h-feed, microformats2, microformats1, etc. [https://kylewm.com/reply/2014/06/06/1] 
* In the Bridgy mould, would it be useful to extract webmention sending as a separate service that could watch an h-feed and send mentions for links in new entries? PuSH consuming and monitoring for updates/deletes would be a little tricky.
* This is fuzzier. It would be cool to have a proxy server that could generate h-entry's from "arbitrary" sources: e.g., silos that are already supported by a-u or oembed, plus tumblr, blogger, wordpress, NYT, Wapo, LATimes. Useful for fetching reply context, maybe other stuff.
