'''<dfn>Kartik Prabhu</dfn>''' does mathematical physics and some other stuff, including posting and experimenting with the indieweb on [http://kartikprabhu.com Parallel Transport].

__NOTOC__

== Setup ==

* I mainly use my own custom setup called '''[[Bundle]]'''.

* Django+MySQL with a lot of custom Python code, hosted on [https://www.webfaction.com/ Webfaction.com]

* Post types currently active: Article and Notes

* Webmentions sent to all links using [https://github.com/bear/ronkyuu ronkyuu]

* POSSE notes to Twitter using Bridgy/publish.

== Itching ==

* Improve webmention parsing using mf2py. (Done: as of at least 2014-04-22)

* enable [[backfeed]] using Bridgy. (Done: as of at least 2014-04-22)

* automate sending webmentions in some sane way. (Django post_save signal failed.)

* parse received webmentions using an asyc queue.

* move to a file-based storage (consider html+mf2) and use MySQL for meta-cache only. See [[databases-antipattern]] (responses to articles moved to YAML files.)

* start posting likes, reposts, links

* enable https and SSL stuff (Done: as of 2014-05-23)

* use [[micropub]] to build a good posting UI alternative to Django's admin.

* indie reader (far-future)

* enable micro-level responses aka [[annotations]] using [[fragmention]].

* receive mentions on Notes. (Hint: use url to identify posts instead of DB objects.) (Done: as of 2014-04-23)

* better homepage idea: use homepage for updates, including status (like currently reading), latest notes and articles and also entry points to explore other things on the site. Reserve about page for info about self and site. Why?: homepage is where readers would land first, and presumably they are more interested in "what's new?"

* better reply-context and embedding.

* auto-linking in notes and responses

* chaining conversations.
