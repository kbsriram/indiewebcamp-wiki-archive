__NOTOC__

I post articles, notes, photos on [http://kartikprabhu.com Parallel Transport].

== Setup ==

* Django+MySQL with a lot of custom Python code, hosted on [https://www.webfaction.com/ Webfaction.com]

* Post types currently active: Article and Notes

* Webmentions sent to all links using [https://github.com/bear/ronkyuu ronkyuu]

* POSSE notes to Twitter using Bridgy/publish.

== Itching ==

* Improve webmention parsing using mf2py. (Done: as of at least 2014-04-22)

* enable [[backfeed]] using Bridgy. (Done: as of at least 2014-04-22)

* automate sending webmentions in some sane way. (Django post_save signal failed.)

* parse received webmentions using an asyc queue.

* move to a file-based storage (consider html+mf2) and use MySQL for meta-cache only. See [[databases-antipattern]] (responses to articles moved to YAML files.)

* start posting likes, reposts, links

* enable https and SSL stuff

* use [[micropub]] to build a good posting UI alternative to Django's admin.

* indie reader (far-future)

* enable micro-level responses aka [[annotations]] using [[fragmention]].

* receive mentions on Notes. (Hint: use url to identify posts instead of DB objects.) (Done: as of 2014-04-23)
