== WordPress for Indieweb == 

One of the smallest yet largest issues is how to integrate Indieweb concepts into WordPress. WordPress has its own way of doing things, and one of the hardest things is to plan things out so they neatly integrate into the system. While WordPress is designed to be extensible, if you are replacing large amounts of core functionality, you might as well roll your own system.

Originally the different content types were implemented on my site using a combination of the  [https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats Post Formats] system in Wordpress and the [https://github.com/dshanske/indieweb-taxonomy Indieweb-Taxonomy] plugin enabled to support markup of posts with like, reply, etc.

Post Formats are a setting that is used to allow for custom theming of a post. In reality, they are a taxonomy of their own. So, the Taxonomy plugin will remain as it is, but a new version, [https://github.com/dshanske/indieweb-post-kinds Indieweb-Post-Kinds] will replace it.

== For the Future ==

* Working on a fork of the _s starter theme that is mf2/indieweb ready
* Continuing to improve the Semantic Comments plugin, which generates alternate displays of webmentions, such as [[facepile]] to be more extensible.
** Just rewrote the code to use WordPress's Comment_Walker class and a lot less CSS, which means it should integrate better into the themes it is activated on.
** Want to add several different styles of Facepile into the mix.
* Expanding the H-Card Tools widget plugin to support a variety of h-card functions for WordPress
* Expanding the Indieweb Taxonomy plugin for additional data to be stored, including profile photo, date of publish, etc. Looking for its storage of h-card data to be integrated with previously mentioned H-Card plugin.
* Looking to develop a simpler post editor for notes
* Add reply/like endpoints to the Indieweb Taxonomy plugin
* Automatic Bridgy syndication in the Syndication Links plugin
* Figure out a better unification for post formats and taxonomies
