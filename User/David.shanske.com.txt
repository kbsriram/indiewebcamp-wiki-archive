Working on david.shanske.com. Also working on content for the site. No point in developing the infrastructure without it.

==Current Progress==

* Site uses Wordpress
* Site currently supports designated content display types
* The different content types are implemented using a combination of the  [https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats Post Formats] system in Wordpress. Post Formats are a setting that is used to allow for custom theming of a post and the the [https://github.com/dshanske/indieweb-taxonomy Indieweb-Taxonomy] plugin enabled to support markup of posts with like, reply, etc.
** Articles – longer form content using the Standard Post Format
** Notes – Notes are short content, and I’ve divided them into some types.
*** Status Updates and Asides – Two different choices for displaying the same thing. Status updates display with a profile picture, asides do not.
*** Like or Favorite - Still working on usage of this
*** Bookmark - The equivalent of sharing a link to my feed on various other services. May be with or without excerpt and/or comment
** Photos/Images/Videos – Sharing photos and videos

== Wordpress Development == 

[https://david.shanske.com/projects/indieweb/ Project Pages] for my Indieweb Stuff appear on my website.

* Testing a theme designated as mf2_bootstrap, currently in live use.
* Have written a Wordpress widget to add an h-card to the sidebar, pulling the data from the user profile.
* [https://david.shanske.com/projects/indieweb/syndication-links/ Syndication Links] Plugin will add post metadata in the Wordpress post editor to add syndication data to posts. It also adds code to display the syndication links once entered.
** Plugin will eventually add optional Bridgy Publish capability.
* [https://david.shanske.com/projects/indieweb/semantic-comments/ Semantic Comments] Plugin - Wordpress plugin - Adds a new comment template with facepiles for Webmentions.
* [https://david.shanske.com/projects/indieweb/indieweb-taxonomy/ Indieweb Taxonomy] Plugin - Adds a new taxonomy to Wordpress posts for actions such as like, reply, etc.
* [https://david.shanske.com/projects/indieweb/simple-location/ Simple Location] plugin

== For the Future ==

* Looking to develop a simpler post editor for notes
* Add reply/like endpoints to the Indieweb Taxonomy plugin
* Automatic Bridgy syndication in the Syndication Links plugin
* Figure out a better unification for post formats and taxonomies
