Working on david.shanske.com as a testbed for deployment of some of the techniques to additional sites under my control. Also working on content for the site. No point in developing the infrastructure without it.

==Current Progress==
* Site uses Wordpress
* Created an Indieweb version of _s, the Wordpress starter theme
* Used that to create a Blog theme based on it. Will be backporting some feature enhancements back into the _s forked theme.
* Site currently supports designated content display types
* The different content types are implemented using the [https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats Post Formats] system in Wordpress. Post Formats are a setting that is used to allow for custom theming of a post.
** Articles – longer form content
** Notes – Notes are short content, and I’ve divided them into some types.
** Status Updates and Asides – Two different versions of the same thing. Status updates display with a profile picture, asides do not.
** Photos/Images/Videos – Sharing photos and videos
** Links – sharing a link to a website/story
* Site has the [https://github.com/dshanske/indieweb-taxonomy Indieweb-Taxonomy] plugin enabled to support markup of posts with like, reply, etc.

==In Development==
* Working on a refined version of the previous theme that allows for more flexibility for future changes. In live testing on the site as Website Version 3.0
* Have written a Wordpress widget to add an h-card to the sidebar, pulling the data from the user profile.
* Working on switching publishing from a Wordpress plugin to Bridgy, by creating a simple Bridgy plugin for Wordpress.
** Plugin, tentatively titled Webmention Syndication, will take the post metadata for syndicated URLs portion of the Semantic Comments plugin, as well as some code to store the response URLs from Bridgy to form a simple plugin.
* Semantic Comments Plugin - Wordpress plugin - Adds facepiles for Webmentions, post metadata for syndicated URLs, basic webactions, etc. You can find it at [https://github.com/dshanske/semantic-comments Github]
** The Post Metadata portion of this plugin is being removed
** Webactions no longer fit into this plugin due changes prior to and during Indiewebcamp UK. Will be moving them into the Indieweb Taxonomy plugin where it makes more sense to have them as they refer to actions a user can take on reply, like, etc.
* Simple Location plugin
