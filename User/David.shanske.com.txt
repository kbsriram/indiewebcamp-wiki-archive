Working on david.shanske.com as a testbed for deployment of some of the techniques to additional sites under my control. Also working on content for the site. No point in developing the infrastructure without it.

==Current Progress==
* Site uses Wordpress
* Created an Indieweb version of _s, the Wordpress starter theme
* Used that to create a Blog theme based on it. Will be backporting some feature enhancements back into the _s forked theme.
* Site currently supports designated content display types
* The different content types are implemented using the [https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats Post Formats] system in Wordpress. Post Formats are a setting that is used to allow for custom theming of a post.
** Articles – longer form content
** Notes – Notes are short content, and I’ve divided them into some types.
** Status Updates and Asides – Two different versions of the same thing. Status updates display with a profile picture, asides do not.
** Photos/Images/Videos – Sharing photos and videos
** Links – sharing a link to a website/story
* Site has the [https://github.com/dshanske/indieweb-taxonomy Indieweb-Taxonomy] plugin enabled to support markup of posts with like, reply, etc.

==In Development==
* Working on a refined version of the previous theme that allows for more flexibility for future changes. In live testing on the site as Website Version 3.0
* Have written a Wordpress widget to add an h-card to the sidebar, pulling the data from the user profile.
* [https://github.com/dshanske/syndication-links Syndication Links] Plugin will add post metadata in the Wordpress post editor to add syndication data to posts. It also adds code to display the syndication links once entered.
** Plugin will eventually add optional Bridgy Publish capability.
* [https://github.com/dshanske/semantic-comments Semantic Comments] Plugin - Wordpress plugin - Adds a new comment template with facepiles for Webmentions.
* [https://github.com/dshanske/indieweb-taxonomy Indieweb Taxonomy] Plugin - Adds a new taxonomy to Wordpress posts for actions such as like, reply, etc.
* Simple Location plugin
