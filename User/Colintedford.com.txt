== Colin Tedford ==

I'm a cartoonist, among other things; not a technologist, but I maintain a few websites. I've had mine since 2004, at [http://colintedford.com colintedford.com] since 2005. Started off in Notepad, now on [[WordPress]], planning an eventual switch to something more flat & static. Never really warmed up to the silos (except [[LiveJournal]] which had a great comics community 'til most of them moved to [[Tumblr]] and [[Twitter]]). I have a [[Tumblr]] but haven't used it in a while.

I found IWC some months ago, I don't remember how but I've been interested in related stuff for a while. Currently working my way through the [[IRC/logs|IRC logs]].

=== IndieMark ===

* Level 1: Complete except the microformat one. 0.8
* Level 2: Halfway there. 0.5
* Levels 3-5: Not so much yet.

=== Current setup & practices ===

* Software: [[WordPress]] since 2007-11-07 for main site (maybe earlier for former subsections).
* [[Post]] types:
** [[Articles]]
** [[Notes]]
** [[Comics]] (currently handled by [http://wordpress.org/plugins/webcomic/ Webcomic plugin] which is nice but I'm prepping to stop using it as part of an eventual migration from [[WordPress]])
* [[POSSE]] to:
**  [[Facebook]] manually since I signed up 2009-07-09 (also, I don't have a profile there, just a [http://www.facebook.com/pages/Colin-Tedford/231529070642 page]). This is my highest-priority silo because it's where most of my friends/followers are.
** [[LiveJournal]] via [http://wordpress.org/plugins/lj-xp/ LiveJournal Crossposter plugin] for some years (I did it manually from when I signed up in 2006 to whenever I installed LJ-XP).
* [[PESOS]] from Facebook manually since 2014-06-18 (just copying some older things I only posted there -- mostly Youtube music links)
* [[Backfeed]] from Facebook manually since 2014-06-18, copying new & old comments. Leaving likes alone for now because displaying them isn't important to me, but I might want to collect them eventually & store them somewhere if it's easy.
* [[short-domains|Short domain]] (cted.us) for an eventual link shortener (& current saving of a little typing).

=== To Do ===

==== For now ====

First I want to clear up some long-standing issues with my site, prepping it to migrate from [[WordPress]]. Will add IndieWeb stuff where it makes sense. I'm reluctant to add much new functionality until I've left Wordpress because I'll just lose it when I switch (or I'll delay switching because I feel obliged to re-implement).

* Reformat so I can stop using Webcomic plugin.
** <strike>Decide on code for comic transcripts.</strike> 2014-08-11: Settled on some non-JS show/hide code that mysteriously doesn't work in WordPress, so for now using https://wordpress.org/plugins/azurecurve-toggle-showhide/ .
** <strike>Migrate transcripts.</strike> Done 2014-08-12.
** Migrate comic images. One...by...one :(
** Apply custom taxonomy to comics so I don't have to have a category for each one.
** Disable plugin.
* Switch to more responsive theme, tweak as needed (but don't go overboard).
* Add [[microformats]].
* Self-signed [[https|SSL]] for logins.
* Better comics navigation.
* Yearly & monthly archives (no more paginated).
* Mockup post-WordPress site HTML, CSS, & UI. Use this (with tweaks as needed to template-ify) as template for post-WordPress system.

==== Whenever I feel like it ====

Lower-priority but easy, a nice way to make progress when I'm not up to harder problems.

* Backfeed [[LiveJournal]] comments manually (considering using the LJ Crossposter plugin option to turn off LJ commenting & direct commenters to the original post so I only have to collect the old ones. Not urgent since I don't get many comments there.)
* Maybe check if I posted anything only to [[LiveJournal]] that I care to import
* Backfeed [[Tumblr]] comments (ie. any added content from reposts) manually
* Maybe check if I care to import anything I only posted to [[Tumblr]]
* Import whatever "posts" I can from the old static version of my site via the Internet Archive.
* Distinguish [[photos]] as a [[post]] type, except more generically call them "pictures".

==== Eventually ====

* Auto-[[POSSE]] to & auto-[[backfeed]] from [[Facebook]] ([[backfeed]] is more urgent; [[POSSE]]ing by hand is pretty easy).
* Migrate from [[WordPress]] to something mostly static. Considering [http://middlemanapp.com/ Middleman] but I have a lot of details to figure out (e.g. I want to be able to post when I'm away from my computer). Also entertaining pipe dreams of learning to program and building something myself. I'd like to have a mostly-static system that's easy for laypeople to use (both for myself & so I can recommend it to people I know), but if I have to do it myself it may be a *long* wait.
* <strike>Better distinguish notes.</strike> I don't want to maintain a rigid distinction between [[notes]] and [[articles]] but I want readers to be able to filter out the higher-volume small stuff. I think anything with no title and only one paragraph will be a "note". Anything with a title (that isn't another more specialized post type) will be an article. I might highlight articles somehow on the home page (like surround it with a box). Also might put an expansion toggle on each article on the homepage like [[User:Tommorris.org|Tom Morris]] does (I can't find his post about it but you can see examples at http://tommorris.org). so long posts don't mess up the flow, visitors down have to click through to a separate page, and feed readers can still get the whole post without having to follow the link.
* Send, receive, & display [[Webmention]]s. In line with my own current posting practice I would like to allow updates, but marked up correction-style with strikeouts & additions (which sounds hard to do). For [[delete|deletions]] I guess I'd just strikeout the whole comment & add a note that the author deleted it. Or I could just show the newest version with a link to archived older version(s).
* Not sure about [[likes]]. I certainly like knowing someone liked something I did, but I don't know how compelled I feel to display that info.
* [[Events]].
* [[RSVP]]s.
* Mobile posting. Need something to replace the [[WordPress]] app (which I only started using in 2014-06 as I started finally getting my site in shape). Online admin? App? Local webform? SMS? I'd like to keep the site itself as static as possible.
* [[Audio]].
* [[Video]].
* [[Reader]] (including legacy formats) -- currently planning to try [https://owncloud.com/ Owncloud]'s [[reader]] (since I want to try Owncloud anyway), but keeping [http://selfoss.aditu.de/ Selfoss] in mind since it already has a [[microformats]] [https://github.com/aaronpk/selfoss plugin].
* [[Hashtags]]
* Autolink bare URLs.
* Algorithmic link shortener. Mainly wanting short URLs for print, to link to a full comic from an excerpt (though I'm sure I'll enjoy the other uses as well).
* Whole-site [[https]].
* [[Products]] -- I want to get back to selling my comics & merch through my own site instead of a third-party site.
* Somehow integrate my website, my desktop wiki ([http://zim-wiki.org/ Zim]), and my still-forming personal log (just monthly text files w/ some personal formatting & hashtags, not yet hooked up to any processing) since they all overlap in function. Zim actually does function as a simple site generator and it's repeatedly impressed me as a program; I have a pipe dream of learning Python and writing some plugins (if even needed -- whenever I think I've hit a limit it turns out Zim can actually do it!) to make Zim do all the stuff. First step with the Zim pipe dream would be to just learn its template system.
* [[Wiki]] pages, maybe (definitely for my comics group's website).
* I mostly don't care if my site is "real-time", but am intrigued by Indieweb [[messaging]].

=== Former setup & practices ===

* Hand-coding in Notepad (2005 through 2007). Main content types were [[notes]] (I didn't title my news updates ... and deleted them when they got old!) and [[comics]].
* [[Blogger]] (self-hosted version) (2006? through 2007?) -- I don't think I ever used it for my main site but I did for one of my comic series. Mainly [[comics]] with perhaps an occasional [[articles|article]].
