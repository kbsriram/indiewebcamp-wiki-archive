== [https://github.com/dissolve/postly Postly] ==
This is going to be my personal site and an MVC framework to build off of for others.  Currently in its initial stages, it is based on system libraries from [http://www.opencart.com OpenCart]

TODO for Postly  (this will grow a lot i'm sure)
# <s>Rip main libraries out of OpenCart and Customize to run a simple site</s>
# <s>Get main page up and running with basic h-entry formatting</s>
# <s>Get Posts working</s>
# <s>Proper routing for permalinks</s>
# <s>Make it Live!</s>
# <s>Release on GitHub</s>
# <s>Administration Pages (minimally working, still needs a lot of work)</s> I have somewhat abandoned this in favor of micropub
# <s>Get Comments working (I may not do this, comments will have to be webmention/pingback)</s>
# <s>Personal theme (still based on SemPress)</s> this changes on its own over time as needed
# <s>Set up automatic syndication to G+, FB, and Twitter</s> done via brid.gy
# <s>backfeed</s> via brid.gy
# <s>webmention</s>
# <s>micropub</s> avalable at https://ben.thatmustbe.me/new
# <s>reply-context</s>
# <s>comment edit/delete</s> Done but untested
# <s>RSVP to Events</s>
# <s>https for everything</s>
# <s>display list of recent draft links when logged in as site owner</s>
# <s>webmention sending done asynchronously</s>
# <s>delete entries (leave tombstone and hide)</s>
# <s>draft editions (hide from feed, but can be viewed by URL)</s>
# <s>allow sending micropub to not use field names with []</s> I now send both so php and non-php users can receive. I still contend that comma delimited is not a good idea, but i'll support it for now.
# <s>error message display</s>
# context messages to store both short and full urls to save extra polling.
# webactions (maybe)
# Contacts List (see below)
# geotag / location data in posts (storing but no display yet)
# [[webmention#de-duplication|Deduplication]] (or better yet: [[webmention#prefer_original_posts|prefer original posts]]) of incoming webmentions, (and display posse'd copy links of context-history and replies) (see https://ben.thatmustbe.me/note/2014/9/12/1/_ )
# Authentication Host
# Micropub expanded to create more post types as well as edit/<s>delete</s> posts
# Create Indie Events (and receive RSVPs)
# Fix caching of archived pages.  Should not cache current mont/day or should clear on edit/create for that month
# <s>implement [[permashortcitation]] when post is sufficiently short enough.</s>
# Post types <s>Note</s> <s>Article</s> <s>Photo</s> <s>Reply</s> <s>RSVP</s> <s>Like</s> <s>Bookmark</s> CheckIn Video Audio Poll
# anything else I can think of

== Contacts List ==
This is just my ideas for an IndieWeb based contacts application.  I will host my contact info on my own site as [[h-card]] but only public information.  If a user visits the site with a key (custom to them) in the GET value, they get additional info such as mailing address, phone number, etc.   Once I have have access to other's contact info, I build my contact list in a private section of my site.  I could then access this information from an app on my phone or other device or directly through my website.

For key negotiation my current idea is to use webmention on the author page.
Alice wants to get Bob's info in her contact list.  
# Alice inputs Bob's URL in to her site.
# Alice's site gets Bob's site to discover his Author page (perhaps she had to put in his author URL directly)
# Alice's site parses Bob's h-card and adds this information to her contact list.
# Alice's site sends a webmention to Bob's author page saying that he has been added to her contacts.
# Bob's site receives this request and finds Alice's H-card on her site.
# Bob's site records this information for Bob to review later.
# Later Bob logs in to his site and sees that Alice has requested his information.
# Bob decides to give Alice all his contact information.
# Bob is asked to review Alice's URL to be sure that this URL is actually her site.
# Optionally Bob can add this info to his contacts, generating a request in the other direction.
# Bob approves her request and grants full access.
# Bob's site sends a web-mention to Alice's site that includes a generated key for Alice.
# Alice's site uses this key to get the updated contact information from Bob's site (with the key in the URL)

'''Other ideas/considerations:''' 

Use Push notifications rather than h-card on author page.  This would mean a complex push structure and people would know the second you remove access possibly.  Not sure I would like that.

Ability to grant access to specific pieces to certain people.  I might want a close friend to have all my information but others to have only a subset.

Friends without webmention systems can just ask for a URL that I can e-mail them.   I can still specify the key and thereby control their level of access.

Sites should be able to receive keys before they make a request.   (I know my friend will want my full info, so i just send him a link right away)

= Side Projects =

Been working to clean up the [https://github.com/dissolve/wiki mediawiki indieweb template] for aaronpk so we can get mediawiki up to date.

Trying to keep documented the specification as I extend it to complete [https://github.com/dissolve/webmention webmention].  Basically the asynchronous stuff was never specified.
