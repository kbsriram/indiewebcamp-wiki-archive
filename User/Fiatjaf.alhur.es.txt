==Projects==

* [[coisas]] ([https://github.com/fiatjaf/coisas GitHub]) is a multipurpose website engine that runs totally in the browser and deploys to [[GitHub Pages]] (or any thing with a similar API -- today none), the deployed website features infinitely nestable pages, with a hierarchy organization. As they are static, the websites generated by [[coisas]] don't support webmentions or any of these complex things.

* [[microanalytics]] ([https://github.com/fiatjaf/microanalytics GitHub]) is a [[CouchApp]] that you can host (in fact, you need to) in your own [[CouchDB]] and does [[website-analytics]]. It is easy to set-up, it gives you a nice javascript snippet which loads a small library, loads quickly and is very flexible, working with custom events. It's also nice, for the command line lovers, to visualize the data, as it comes with a humble [https://github.com/fiatjaf/microanalytics-cli Python command line client].

* [[scrapboard]] ([https://github.com/fiatjaf/scrapboard GitHub]) is a [[CouchApp]] that replicates the functionality of the old [[Orkut scrapbook]], but in a decentralized way, as every person that wants her personal [[scrapboard]] has to host it in their [[CouchDB]]. However, [[scrapboard]] is not an island. It is configured to work with identification based on any personal website with a [[h-card]] and [[webmentions]], and with anonymous postings (identified by an optional name).
