I'm best known for [[Bridgy]], a hosted service that provides [[backfeed]], [[POSSE]], and [[webmention]]s for blog providers.

I also wrote and maintain [https://github.com/snarfed/activitystreams-unofficial activitystreams-unofficial], a library and REST API that converts between silo APIs and [[ActivityStreams]]/[[microformats2]] ([https://snarfed.org/2012-03-12_activitystreams_for_facebook_and_twitter details], [https://github.com/search?q=%40snarfed+unofficial related projects]). A few IndieWeb projects use it, e.g. [https://facebook-atom.appspot.com/ facebook-atom] and [https://twitter-atom.appspot.com/ twitter-atom].

My web site is [https://snarfed.org/ snarfed.org]. It's [[WordPress]] with IndieWeb plugins and minor tweaks. I [[POSSE]] posts manually, I use [https://www.brid.gy/about#publish Bridgy Publish] to POSSE [[likes]], [[comments]], [[repost|retweets]], and [[RSVPs]] automatically, and I use [[Bridgy]] to backfeed silo responses.
