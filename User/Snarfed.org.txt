== my indie web projects ==

* '''Current:''' [http://brid.gy/ brid.gy] [[backfeed]]s comments on POSSEd silo posts via webmention. It's up and running! I'm currently tweaking it and adding features, e.g. likes/favorites and reposts.
* '''Next:''' http://freedom.io/ migrates your silo posts to a blog. It currently migrates from Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and Instagram to WordPress, Tumblr, and Blogger. It's functional, but needs UX design. Design and build the UX, then launch it.
* The "unofficial" collection implements the [[OStatus]] protocol suite for silos: Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and (partially) Instagram. The naming pattern and branding is pretty bad, and probably needs a reboot. Suggestions are welcome!
** [https://github.com/snarfed/activitystreams-unofficial activitystreams-unofficial] is a library and REST API that converts silo data to [[microformats2]] and [[ActivityStreams]] formats. [https://snarfed.org/2012-03-12_activitystreams_for_facebook_and_twitter More details.]
** [https://github.com/snarfed/portablecontacts-unofficial portablecontacts-unofficial] is a library and REST API that converts silo social graphs to [[PortableContacts]] format. [https://snarfed.org/2012-02-22_portablecontacts_for_facebook_and_twitter More details.]
** [https://github.com/snarfed/webfinger-unofficial webfinger-unofficial] is a [[WebFinger]] server for silos. [https://snarfed.org/2012-01-16_webfinger_for_facebook_and_twitter More details.]
** [https://github.com/snarfed/salmon-unofficial salmon-unofficial] is a [http://salmon-protocol.org/ Salmon] server for silos. [https://snarfed.org/2012-07-14_salmon_for_facebook_twitter_and_google_plus More details.]
** [https://github.com/snarfed/ostatus-unofficial ostatus-unofficial] will eventually implement the  rest of [[OStatus]] for silos - PuSH hub and server, subscribe/unsubscribe, status updates and pings, etc. It's currently incomplete.
* [https://facebook-atom.appspot.com/ facebook-atom] and [https://twitter-atom.appspot.com/ twitter-atom] generate and serve Atom feeds of your Facebook news feed, Twitter stream, and any Twitter list. [https://snarfed.org/2012-03-12_activitystreams_for_facebook_and_twitter More background.] They're built on top of activitystreams-unofficial.
* [https://snarfed.org/2012-11-30_facebook_to_wordpress Facebook to Wordpress] is a script that copies your Facebook posts to a WordPress blog of your choice. It was the inspiration for http://freedom.io/.

== my indie web setup ==

https://snarfed.org/ is my home. [https://snarfed.org/about More details.] It's WordPress with the [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-uf2 uf2] and [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-webmention webmention] plugins, with some tweaks, so it serves [[microformats2]] and [https://snarfed.org/replies sends] and accepts [[webmentions]].

I [[POSSE]] to Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and Instagram manually. I've tried automating, but I usually syndicate to just a subset of the silos, depending on the content, and I sometimes customize the syndicated posts' content too. My post volume is low enough that it's not (yet) a burden.

I use http://brid.gy/ and https://salmon-unofficial.appspot.com/ to [[backfeed]] comments/replies.
