== Projects ==

* [http://sixtwothree.org sixtwothree.org]: Powered by Jekyll, source available on [https://github.com/jgarber623/sixtwothree.org GitHub].
* [http://webmention.sixtwothree.org webmention.sixtwothree.org]: My webmention endpoint, powered by Sinatra.
* [https://github.com/jgarber623/craft-webmention-client Craft Webmention Client Plugin]: A PHP plugin for the Craft CMS that sends webmentions.

== Working On ==

* Building [https://github.com/jgarber623/FrancisCMS FrancisCMS], an IndieWeb-friendly CMS written in Ruby and Sinatra. My goal is to replace my Jekyll-powered personal site with FrancisCMS.
* Open-sourcing [http://webmention.sixtwothree.org webmention.sixtwothree.org]
* Automatically send webmentions when a new post is published. (Idea: external service watches an RSS feed for new feed items, parses new feed item for links, and sends webmentions to those links)
* Add Links section to site and POSSE copies to Delicious (related: import existing [https://delicious.com/jgarber Delicious bookmarks])
* Figure out how to programmatically add syndicated copies links (e.g. Twitter, Facebook) to posts
