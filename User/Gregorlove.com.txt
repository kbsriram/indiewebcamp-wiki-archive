My name is gRegor Morrill and I have been blogging on my domain since about 2002 using [http://nucleuscms.org Nucleus CMS]. I have contributed to the Nucleus core code and several plugins over the years; I am implementing a plugin for [[webmention]]s and other Indie Web goodies.

PHP is my primary language, but I am branching out into Python lately to broaden my experience.

== Contributions ==
* [https://github.com/gRegorLove/nucleus-plugin-webmention Webmention plugin] for Nucleus CMS

== Interests ==
I am interested in:
* Adding a "notes" stream to my site distinct from the articles.
** Setting up distinct, well-designed presentations for different types of notes (e.g. quotes, links, status update, video), a la Tumblr
* Syndicating notes/articles to Twitter and Facebook ([[POSSE]])
* Coming up with a better acronym than "POSSE." It sounds silly. ;)
* Adding SSL. Secure all the things! ''Damn the Man''.
* Setting up PGP ''securely''. Again, Damn the Man.
* Attending IndieWebCamp 2014 (Portland)

== Braindump ==
* Help decrease jargon/improve usability.
** E.g. Review/improve [[WordPress#Themes]] so we can point to 'install this theme, this plugin, and start posting'

== My site ==
As mentioned above, I have been using Nucleus CMS for quite some time. The extensibility of it attracted me all those years ago. Unfortunately, development on Nucleus has nearly stopped and I am unsure of its future. I am tempted to rebuild my site on the Processwire framework, but for now I am still with Nucleus. I thought contributing some indieweb plugins would be good, even if very few people end up using them.
