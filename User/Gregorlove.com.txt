My name is gRegor Morrill and I have been blogging on my domain since about 2002 using [[Nucleus|Nucleus CMS]]. I have contributed to the Nucleus core code and several plugins over the years; I am implementing a plugin for [[webmention]]s and other Indie Web goodies.

[[PHP]] is my primary programming language, but I would like to branch out into [[Python]] to broaden my experience.

I helped start the Chicago chapter of the [[Homebrew Website Club]] and enjoyed attending my first IndieWebCamp, [[2014|Portland 2014]].

== Contributions ==
* [https://github.com/gRegorLove/nucleus-plugin-webmention Webmention plugin] for [[Nucleus]] CMS

== My site ==
As mentioned above, I have been using Nucleus CMS for quite some time. The extensibility of it attracted me all those years ago. Unfortunately, development on Nucleus has nearly stopped and I am unsure of its future. I am tempted to rebuild my site on the Processwire framework, but for now I am still with Nucleus. I thought contributing some indieweb plugins would be good, even if very few people end up using them.

* My [[User:Gregorlove.com/webmention|webmention implementation]]
* My [[User:Gregorlove.com/notes|notes implementation]]

== Interests ==
In no particular order, I am interested in:
* Adding a "notes" stream to my site distinct from the articles.
** Setting up distinct, well-designed presentations for different types of notes (e.g. quotes, links, status update, video), a la Tumblr
* Displaying webmention replies on notes like I do on articles.
* Caching webmention author photos locally
** Avoid breaking images when a Twitter user changes their avatar
** Be able to deliver all images over https, even if the author's site does not support it.
* Syndicating notes/articles to Twitter and Facebook ([[POSSE]])
* Coming up with a better acronym than "POSSE." It sounds silly. ;)
* <strike>Adding SSL.</strike> Migrate all content to SSL-only. Secure all the things! ''Damn the Man''
** SSL support added 2014-07-08. Content is still available on both http and https
* Setting up PGP ''securely''. Again, Damn the Man.
* Determine what it will take to migrate from my CMS to the custom CMS I set up for Amanda (see below)
* My [[User:Gregorlove.com/webmention#Todo|Webmention to-do]] list
* My [[User:Gregorlove.com/notes#Todo|Notes to-do]] list
* Work on [[media_checkin]]s for books I'm reading and music I'm listening to, perhaps others.
** I particularly enjoy using Goodreads.com currently to track my reading progress. Would like to do that on my site and cross-post there, instead.
* Tweak new wiki theme
* Set up [[checkins]], display maps with OpenStreetMap
* Set up [[micropub]]
* Post events on my own site
* Work on a simple [[HWC]] graphic for use on event posts (specifically on Facebook)
* Queue sending webmentions so the posting UI does not hang
* Publish [[like]]s or — more likely (no pun intended) — favorites/stars.
** Optionally display them on a dedicated page, sorted by most recently starred.
** Optionally allow sorting the starred item's original publish date.

=== Completed ===
* <strike>Help [[User:Amandamaclean.com|Amanda MacLean]] get set up posting on her own domain at [[2014|IndieWebCamp West 2014]]</strike>
** Set up a basic, custom CMS using ProcessWire at http://battlestaramandica.amandamaclean.com

== Braindump ==
* Help decrease jargon/improve usability.
** E.g. Review/improve [[WordPress#Themes]] so we can point to 'install this theme, this plugin, and start posting'
