== inbox ==
I'm collecting requests from [[IRC]] here when they're something I can't handle quickly and immediately. Roughly FIFO, feel free to re-arrange if you have reasons to suggest a specific prioritization
* ... add here

== my indie web setup ==
* http://tantek.com is my primary home where I post:
** [[notes]] and [[POSSE]] them (abbreviated if necessary) to:
*** [[Twitter]] - https://twitter.com/t which then cross-posts to:
**** [[Facebook]]
** [[articles]] and [[POSSE]] their name/title and permalink to:
*** [[Twitter]] - https://twitter.com/t which then cross-posts to:
**** [[Facebook]]
** [[replies]] and [[POSSE]] them (abbreviated if necessary) to:
*** [[Twitter]] - with destination threading to help the Twitter user's experience.

=== silo posting ===
In general I treat [[silos]] as building blocks for my own indie web architecture. They're just another [LEGO] brick in the wall as it were.

However there are some content types that I still post to silos, and am using a [[PESETAS]] architecture with two destinations as a stopgap / copying mechanism.
* [[Tumblr]] - http://tantek.tumblr.com - primary [[PESETAS]] destination, has a [[feed]], and I've customized it with [[microformats2]] [[h-entry]] and [[rel-author]] support. As of [http://tantek.com/2013/183/t2/pesetasing-tumblr-stopgap-ownyourdata 2013-182 I'm PESETASing] from:
** [[Instagram]] - [[photos]] and [[videos]] nearly daily
** [[Flickr]] - [[photos]] and [[videos]] occasionally, in bursts
** [[ThisIsMyJam]] - occasional posts of what I'm listening to
** [[Path]] - I rarely (if ever) post actual content to Path, but if I do, it'll get cross-posted here
* [[Twitter]] - https://twitter.com/t_silos - secondary [[PESETAS]] destination for everything that doesn't cross-post to Tumblr.
** [[Nike+]] - (nearly) daily fitness activity/metrics, e.g. walking/running
** [[Vine]] - links to short [[videos]] I create perhaps a few times a week
** [[ThisIsMyJam]] - occasional posts of what I'm listening to
** [[Path]] - I rarely (if ever) post actual content to Path, but if I do, links to it get cross-posted to @t_silos

My hope is that by aggregating my silo posting into just two destinations like that, especially Tumblr with a [[microformats2]] supporting theme, that as I add support for content types like [[photos]], [[video]], metrics, jams to my own site, it will be easier to port over past content to my site for historical reference.

Silos I'm using without a copy destination:
* [[Foursquare]] - I treat my Foursquare [[checkins]] as semi-private to friends on that silo, and thus I don't have a public PESETAS setup for it. I'm hoping to skip the PESETAS/PESOS step with checkins and implement native checkins directly on my site, and POSSE them out to Foursquare (as Ben Werdmuller does with [[idno]]).
* [[PBWorks]] - I have a wiki (AKA PBWiki) hosted there via redirect URL of http://tantek.com/w/ - and again, hope to skip the PESETAS/PESOS step and directly switch to [[wiki]] pages on my own site.

__TOC__

== my indie web projects ==
Stuff I've written to advance the Indie Web (and runs live on tantek.com) some of which you may be able to re-use hopefully for your own IndieWeb site!
* [[CASSIS]] - http://cassisproject.com/ ([http://twitter.com/cassisjs @cassisjs]) open source Javascript/PHP hybrid framework that runs natively in both. Where I write and keep common functionality for everything else.
* [[Falcon]] - http://tantek.com/w/Falcon ([http://twitter.com/falcon @falcon]) personal site publishing
* [[Whistle]] - http://tantek.com/w/Whistle - personal URL shortener

== need help with ==
Things I'm either stuck on or have been unable to make progress on.
=== RelMeAuth PHP library ===
The RelMeAuth PHP library broke at some point, likely due to Twitter's front-end website changes, maybe t.co encoding people's URLs. I haven't had a chance to work on fixing it.

Here is my demo deployment:
* http://tantek.com/relmeauth/

And the open source on GitHub
* https://github.com/themattharris/RelMeAuth/

Any help would be awesome! The open source on GitHub has everything you need to deploy a test demo deployment like my own in case you want to try fixing it and testing it with a complete demo UI.

* Hi Tantek, I made some changes to parse the new Twitter HTML (seems to be out of reach of SimpleXMLParser even after running tidy?). Pull request here, see what you think! https://github.com/themattharris/RelMeAuth/pull/5 [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]] 12:57, 21 September 2014 (PDT)

== working on ==
Things I'm working on for IndieWebCamp and my own site. As well as '''<span id="Itches">Itches</span>'''.

Personal indieweb site functionality (adding to tantek.com) using my own personal content publishing software '''[[Falcon]]'''
* High level goal: '''Replace all usage of [[Twitter]] with using my own website instead'''
** This means implementing all [[Twitter#Features]] simplified, faster, better in [[Falcon]]
* '''[[Falcon#Working_On|Falcon: Working On]]'''
* '''[[Falcon#Itches|Falcon: Itches]]'''
* Next: '''Replace all usage of [[Facebook]] with using my own website instead'''. Key use-cases:
** [[event]] posts and POSSE - including [[backfeed]] of all interactions
** [[RSVP]] to / [[reply]] comments on FB events - including [[backfeed]] of all interactions
** [[Falcon#Private_Groups|private groups]]
* Then similarly replace all other [[#silo_posting]].

Community:
* document [[2014/Cambridge/Demos|IndieWebCamp 2014 Cambridge demos]] similar to [[2014/UK/Demos]] 
** and then blog IndieWebCamp 2014 Cambridge Hack Day demos similar to [http://tantek.com/2014/259/b1/indiewebcampuk-hack-day-https-webactions IndieWebCampUK 2014 Hack Day demos]
* process [[h-card#Issues]] - blocking several indieweb community member personal use-cases
* read <cite>[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/waxpancake/the-return-of-upcomingorg/posts/1010515 Open Source, Teamin' Up, The Stack, and Looking Forward]</cite> (including comments) and:
** contribute/respond from an IndieWeb perspective accordingly to [[Upcoming]], and [https://github.com/upcoming/upcoming/wiki/Use-Cases-and-Feature-Requests Upcoming github wiki use-cases]
* expand [[invitation]] based on [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-10-20#t1413860150589 brainstorm in IRC] re: POSSEing, backfeeding, proxying etc.
** incorporate / bi-directional merge appropriately with [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-event-brainstorming#Invitations microformats h-event invitations brainstorm]
* Add slides, video, etc. links of PdF IndieWeb talk to https://pdf14.hackpad.com/Save-the-Internet-Keynotes-Zb58Z1QFrJq
** Add anything else relevant IndieWeb related to https://pdf14.hackpad.com/
* IndieWebCamp '''[[2014]]''' NYC - blogging about it afterwards.
* '''[[CASSIS]]''' - update all NewBase60 code to be cc0 (it's good enough, and Will Norris needs it for his Go port!)
* '''[[projects]]''' - continue significant update per [[projects#About_This_Page]]
* '''[[reply]] vs [[comments]]''' - split reply permalink vs. comments display under a post.
* '''[[link-preview]]''' - something standard for [[silos]] to implement (in addition to all their variant site-specific approaches) when providing link previews of my permalinks
* '''[[2013/UK/Indiemark]]''' - complete updating [[IndieMark]] accordingly
* '''[[code-of-conduct]]''' - fairly done, worth reviewing/iterating periodically. Keeping here in this list until indiewebcamp shows consistent diverse participation.
* review and simplify [[comments-presentation#How_to_display|comments presentation display]] to remove conditionals that overlap/wrap in odd places (collected 2014-049)
* add some test examples for ellipsizing here: https://github.com/tantek/cassis/issues/14 (collected 2014-049)


And these too which need to get integrated by priority order into Falcon Working On / Itches sections:
* '''[[citation]] UI''' - to provide simple copy/paste UI for citing posts (articles (done), notes, other) from my site.
* '''[[webactions]]''' - to achieve and exceed UX parity with [[Twitter]]'s UI on notes on my own site
* '''[[wiki]]''' - I'd like to implement static-file based wiki-like editing/versioning functionality on the static pages on my site, perhaps with explicit "save" edits posted to my updates as [http://tantek.com/w/Whistle#design d - diff, edit, change] [[posts]].

== community projects ==
Other community projects that I contribute to to help enable the Indie Web and everyone owning their own data.
* http://microformats.org/ - data formats for the rest of us

=== previously ===
I used to contribute to these too:
* http://activitystrea.ms/ - formats for sharing "activities", largely defunct except for a low value mailing list (google group). See [[ActivityStreams]] on this wiki for latest thinking.
* http://federatedsocialweb.net/ - community/forum for discussing how to federate among indie web (and other) sites. Started a slow death after W3C took it over. Now just a noisy W3C mailing list populated mostly by armchair architects.

* [http://tantek.com/2011/010/b1/owning-your-data Owning Your Data]
* http://www.google.com/search?nfpr=1&q=site:tantek.com+ownyourdata

== skills ==
I am comfortable with the following indieweb [[creator]] skills:
* coding (HTML, microformats, CSS, some javascript/PHP)
* information architecture (taxonomy, hierarchy)
* URL design
* interaction design

I am working on learning better:
* copywriting
* typography
* visual design

== want to work especially with ==
* visual designers - especially those who have an indieweb presence and want to discuss coding and information architecture improvements.
* UX designers - can never work with too many UX folks.
* good writers/bloggers
* type nerds. who doesn't?

== figured out ==
Things I feel like I've figured out pretty well, have shipped on my own site, can depend on, and am available to help explain to others.
* [[POSSE]], in particular
** [[Twitter#POSSE_to_Twitter|POSSE to Twitter]]
