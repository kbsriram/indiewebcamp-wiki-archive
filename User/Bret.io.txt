== my indie web setup ==
* http://bret.io is my site where I experiment with indieweb standards.
* It is built with Jekyll in safe mode.
* I have been trying to use prose + post commit hooks and client site javascript to enhance on top of what one can do with a static site.
* I'm doing this for fun and to learn.
* Not quite sure where to go from here.  I will probably just iterate on top of what I have for now, and then maybe start on something more sophisticated. 
* The best way to get how any of my projects work is to just ask in IRC.

== Current IndieWeb Projects ==
I have a Non-CS background, but these are things I think I am able to achieve reasonably. 
* Displaying Pingback.me Data via JSONP and javascript embeds.
** [https://github.com/bcomnes/pingback-js Pingback.js] - The eventual home of this project.
* Github Pages PuSH race [http://ivanzuzak.info/2011/01/02/enabling-pubsubhubbub-for-github-hosted-blogs.html#par10 condition work around].
* Ways to better handle various [[ posts ]] types in jekyll.
* Generate terminal one liners for sending webmentions/pingbacks automatically during the site build to help facilitate their sending.

== About me ==
Feel free to contact me as "bret" on freenode.

I am a graduate student at Portland State University, and became interested in participating in the web in a bigger way around 2011.
