A directory of my indieweb interests, projects, and events.  I am interested in projects that are low maintenance and long term in scope, p2p and distributed storage systems and anything else that makes publishing easy and fun.

== Current IndieWeb Projects ==
* [http://bret.io bret.io] - my personal website.  Hosted on [[gh-pages]] and rendered in [[jekyll]] safe mode. [https://github.com/bcomnes/bcomnes.github.io source]
* [[gitpub]] - A publishing endpoint for static websites.  Still experimental.  Supports micropub clients. [https://github.com/bcomnes/gitpub source]
* Playing with [[camlistore]] and [[git-annex]].
* [w3c #social] - participating in the w3c social WG/IG as an invited expert (applied).

== Events ==
* (2014) Indiewebcamp - PDX
* (2014 - Present) Homebrew Website Club PDX
* (2014) (remote) Indiewebcamp - Hollywood 
* (2013) [[OSFW3C]] - SF
* (2013) Indiewebcamp - PDX

== Past experiments ==
* [https://github.com/bcomnes/webmention.js webmention.js] - Displays data from [[webmention.io]] on a static site with javascript using jsonp.  Needs some work.  See [https://webmention.herokuapp.com/ webmention.herokuapp.com] for a more functional and documented project currently.  I'll return to this someday.

== About me ==
