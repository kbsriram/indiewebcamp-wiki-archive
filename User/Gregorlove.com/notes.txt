= Notes = 
'''Notes''' are the second indieweb project I will be tackling.

== Posting interface ==
I began by mocking up, in HTML, the form for posting a new [[note]]. I want the form to have a simple and pleasing UI. To do this, I set the font-size larger and put some padding on the form inputs to give them some room to breathe.

I am going to be a bit nontraditional and allow my notes to optionally have a title. Most notes will be short status updates, but I can imagine instances where I might want to jot down some notes with a title.

I decided on one field for the URL if I'm replying-to/reposting. The checkbox below it will differentiate if the note is in-reply-to (default) or a repost of the URL.

Then a separate checkbox determines if I'm also "liking" the URL.

After my initial version, I decided to re-order the fields:
* ''Title'' will be used least often, so it's at the bottom.
* I do not have POSSE set up yet, so ''Syndication'' will always be manual and thus used less often.
* The ''Published Date'' and ''Timezone'' defaults to the current time, so will only be necessary for future posts, or to post in a different timezone.
* ''Note'', ''Likes'', and ''Re-posts'' will be the most commonly used fields, so they're at the top.
