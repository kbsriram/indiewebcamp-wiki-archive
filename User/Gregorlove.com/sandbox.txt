== Determining ==
How to determine authorship of a post on a page - AKA the Authorship [[discovery]] algorithm / processing model for implementations.

To determine authorship of a post on page '''A''':

# Parse the [[h-entry]] for the post on page '''A'''. If no h-entry is found, then there's no post to find authorship for; abort.
# If the h-entry has a p-author, use that and its [[h-card]] to determine the author of the post.
# Otherwise, look for a top-level [[h-feed]] with author property and use that
# Otherwise, if the page is a post permalink page (AKA the post's page) 
## If the page has a [[rel-author]] link, continue with [[#rel-author parsing]] below
## Otherwise, if there's an [[h-card]] on page '''A''' with u-url == rel-author URL, use that h-card for the author.
# Otherwise, no deterministic author can be found. Implementations are encouraged to document additional heuristics below for consideration for incorporation in to the authorship algorithm.

=== rel-author parsing ===
# Fetch the rel-author page '''B''' and parse it for microformats2
## If there's an [[h-card]] with a u-url == u-uid == page '''B''''s URL, use that h-card for the author.
## Otherwise, if there's an [[h-card]] with u-url for which there's also a rel-me URL on page '''B''' (perhaps the same hyperlink element as the u-url, though not required to be), use that h-card for the author.

== Level 2 heading ==

=== Level 3 heading ===
I think this stands out too much from other headings. Recommend the below styling:

<h3 style="font-size: 135%; font-weight: normal;"> Level 3 heading </h3>
This suggested style is font-size: 135% instead of 132%, and font-weight: normal.
