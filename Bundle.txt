== Disclaimer ==
Note: this documentation is purely for informational purposes. 

I'm working on all aspects of this project purely for my own use.

== Post Types ==
Bundle currently supports:
* '''[[articles]]''' - long form posts with content authored as HTML files with some [[Django]] custom templates
* '''[[notes]]''' - short form posts with content authored as plain text which is converted to HTML with smart-typography conversion and auto-linking of URLs. Note can be a [[reply]], [[like]] or [[repost]].

== Tools Used ==
Bundle internally uses the following tools:
* Django as a web-framework for Python
* [[MySQL]] as database
* '''[[mf2py]]''' to parse microformats
* '''[[ronkyuu]]''' to send and receive webmentions

== Working On ==
Currently working on:
* <del datetime="2014-07-15>"Marginalia: a indieweb '''[[annotation]]''' system using '''[[webmention]]''' and '''[[fragmention]]'''</del> See: [https://kartikprabhu.com/article/marginalia]
* Lift: a wrapper around activitystreams ([https://github.com/snarfed/activitystreams-unofficial]) to parse incoming webmentions from silo URLs, maybe also to POSSE in the future.
