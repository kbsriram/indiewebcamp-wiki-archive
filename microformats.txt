<dfn>microformats</dfn> are extensions to HTML for marking up people, organizations, events, locations, blog posts, products, reviews, resumes, recipes etc. Sites use microformats to publish a standard API that is consumed and used by search engines, aggregators, and other tools.

== IndieWeb Use ==
The IndieWeb makes heavy use of:

* [[h-card]] to mark up profiles and authors in posts
* [[h-entry]] to markup [[posts]], [[replies]], etc.
* [[in-reply-to]] to markup links from [[replies]] to original posts.
* [[XFN]] for relationships, and identity consolidation (rel=me), used by [[IndieAuth]]

== FAQ ==
=== Are microformats an API ===
Q: Are microformats an API?

A: No, microformats are more like the information returned from an API.

HTTP GET of a particular URL of a website can be an API. microformats in the resulting HTML  provide the information you might otherwise get from a bespoke API.

Thus combining HTTP, good site URL design, and microformats, your site can be your API. No separate XML/RDF/JSON/??? API endpoints needed. At least for readonly. For a write "API", see [[micropub]].

=== Why not APIs ===
{{main|API}}
Q: Why not APIs instead of microformats?

A: See [[API]], in short:
# secondary URLs
# secondary formats
# API key
# TOS requirements
# Unique snowflakes
# Complexity
# Fragility
