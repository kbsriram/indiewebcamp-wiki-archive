{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Unfollow</dfn>''' is the opposite action of [[follow]]ing someone, typically on a [[silo]], commonly implemented on asymmetric follow silos such as [[Instagram]], [[Google+]], initially pioneered by [[delicious]], [[Flickr]], and [[Upcoming]], but most greatly popularized by [[Twitter]] in contrast to the mutual [[friend]]ing model from explicitly "social" silos from [[Friendster]] to [[Facebook]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
There are no known indieweb examples of an "unfollow" feature.

== Silo Examples ==
Examples of silos that implement an "unfollow" feature in their user interface, along with some differences.

* [[Instagram]] - upon unfollowing someone, refreshing your reader view removes posts from that someone
* [[Google+]] - If you remove someone from circles i.e. unfollow them, then the previous post you received also disappear from timeline.
* [[delicious]]
* [[Facebook]] - started as a symmetric friending model only, later added ability to only "follow" people rather than "add friend" (request friendship)
* [[Flickr]]
* [[Twitter]] - upon unfollowing someone, you won't see future posts from them, but their past posts will still show up in your reader (home page) view 

Past silos:
* [[Friendster]]
* [[Upcoming]]
