'''<dfn>File Storage</dfn>''' is the idea of storing the main site content in flat, readble files instead of a [[database]]

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb members that use File Storage on their personal site.
=== Tantek ===
{{t}} on tantek.com uses flat files for primary storage of content:
* 2010-01-01... present: [[Falcon]] which stores data in flat files, 6 per year (1 per [[bim]]), [http://tantek.com/2010/001/t1/declaring-independence-building-it since 2010-01-01]. See [[Falcon#Storage_format]] for details.
* [http://tantek.com/log/2002/08.html 2002-08]...[http://tantek.com/log/2008/08.html 2008-08] static site directly served from primary storage of flat files, up to 12 per year (1 per Gregorian month).

=== Bear ===
at https://bear.im uses flat files for storage of all content:
* posts - since 2003-12-18 stored as text with some textual/markdown/whatever markup
* webmentions - stored as html in the same directory as the post
* comments - stored as html in the same directory as the post
* feeds and related

=== Bret C. ===
{{ bret }}: I use the following on bret.io
* Stores site content in git
* Renders to html using jekyll/gh-pages

=== Rascul ===
{{rascul}} stores content for https://rascul.io in a [https://git.rascul.io/crash/content git repository].

=== Barnaby Walters ===
Stores all canonical copies of [http://waterpigs.co.uk waterpigs.co.uk] site data in the filesystem

* notes and articles as YAML files with HTML in (wants to change these to HTML+mf2 for browsability, standards support)
* timestamped HTML archives (along with HTTP headers in *-headers.txt) in URL-mimicking folder structures
* Sheet music in ABC files

=== Want to use file storage ===
IndieWeb members that *want* to use File Storage on their personal site:
* [[UserKartikprabhu.com|Kartik]] using [[Bundle]] wants to move away from [[MySQL]] to a HTML+mf2 based file storage for main content. Has played with YAML-based storage but does not like it. Article content is authored and stored in Django-style HTML templates anyway.

== Flat file "CMS" systems in the wild ==

* [http://getgrav.com Grav] is a PHP, YAML, Twig and Markdown Extra based storage project which looks promising.
