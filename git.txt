'''<dfn>Git</dfn>''' is a popular distributed source control management system that can be used to host and share [[code]] from independent sites.

== Software ==
The following software can be installed to provide git services on your own site:
* [https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Gitweb Gitweb] is distributed with git.
* [http://git.zx2c4.com/cgit cgit] is a fast CGI web interface written in C.
* [http://gitolite.com/gitolite gitolite] or [https://github.com/tv42/gitosis gitosis] may be used for repository hosting and access control on your own domain.
* [http://projects.ceondo.com/p/indefero/ Indefero] is a clone of https://code.google.com.
* [http://redmine.org Redmine] is a project management application.
* Depending on your goals, git may be able to handle what you want without any additional interfaces or tools. See http://stackoverflow.com/a/10888536 for some information on that.
* Much more listed at https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Interfaces,_frontends,_and_tools.

== Silos Running Open Source Software ==
You can use their silo or host it yourself with their open source software:
* [https://gitorious.org Gitorious] provides git and collaboration software.
* [[GitLab]] is a complete git hosting solution which provides an interface similar to [[GitHub]].
* http://repo.or.cz provides git repository hosting using [http://repo.or.cz/w/girocco.git girocco].

== Examples ==
IndieWeb implementations of git hosting on your own domain:
* {{rascul}} uses [http://git.zx2c4.com/cgit cgit] and [http://gitolite.com/gitolite gitolite] for http://git.rascul.io.

== Silos ==
* [[Bitbucket]]
* [[GitHub]]
* [[Google Code]]

== POSSE ==
Using [http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks git hooks] one could [[POSSE]] to any of the git silos.

== Documentation ==
There is plenty of good documentation about Git. Here's a few links to get started:
* [http://git-scm.com/docs Official Git reference manual] which is a collection of the Git man pages formatted in HTML.
* [http://git-scm.com/book Pro Git] is an open source book available for free online or for sale from [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1430218339 Amazon] for a hard copy.
* [https://git.wiki.kernel.org Git Wiki] hosted by https://kernel.org.
