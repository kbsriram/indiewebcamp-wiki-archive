'''<dfn>Python</dfn>''' is a programming language and web server runtime environment used for many IndieWeb [[projects]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Examples of indieweb community members who are using Python on their personal sites:
=== Bear ===
[[User:bear.im|Bear's]] uses [[Hakkan]], a Python based static site generator, to run his personal site  [https://bear.im/bearlog/ bearlog] and uses the following Python projects:
* [[ronkyuu]]
* [[mf2py]]

=== Kartik Prabhu ===
[[User:kartikprabhu.com|Kartik Prabhu]]'s personal site [http://kartikprabhu.com/ Parallel Transport] runs on [[Bundle]] and uses the following Python IndieWeb projects:
* ronkyuu
* mf2py
* mf2util

=== Kyle Mahan ===
[[User:kylewm.com|Kyle Mahan]] uses [[Red Wind]] (written in Python) to run his personal site http://kylewm.com/ with the following Python projects:
* [[Flask]]
* [[mf2py]]
* [[mf2util]]

== Libraries == 
Generally useful libraries being developed by IndieWeb participants in Python.

* [[ronkyuu]], a collection of tools for sending webmentions and verifying rel=me.
* [https://github.com/vrypan/webmention-tools webmention-tools], utilities to send webmentions and query [[Webmention.io]]
* [https://github.com/tommorris/mf2py mf2py], a microformats2 parser 
** Bleeding-edge development currently being done on [https://github.com/KartikPrabhu/mf2py Kartik's fork]. Will be folded into the master in the future.
* [[mf2util]] is a microformats2-specific parsing utility. Useful for reading the relevant properties for comments and reply-contexts. Also has some special handling for date/times that converts them into Python datetime or date objects.

=== Third-party Libraries ===
Non-IndieWeb-specific libraries that may still be of interest.

* [http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/ Requests]: By far the best way to interact with any HTML endpoint.
* [http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/ BeautifulSoup4]: sits of top of other HTML parsing libraries (lxml or html5lib) and provides a nice interface for wading through HTML, even horribly broken HTML.
* [[Bleach]]: sanitizer and autolinker. Useful for removing dangerous code from e.g., for displaying remote content. Excludes almost everything by default.

== Projects ==
IndieWeb projects built with Python:
* [[Bridgy]] (open source) runs on Google AppEngine
** [https://github.com/snarfed/activitystreams-unofficial activitystreams-unofficial]
** [https://github.com/snarfed/oauth-dropins oauth-dropins]
** webmention-tools
** mf2py
* [[Hakkan]]
* [[Red Wind]]
* [[Bundle]]

== Hosting ==
Python does not have PHP's ubiquity, and finding hosting can be a little bit more of a challenge. See [[web_hosting]] for more details.

* Google AppEngine (webapp, Django)
* Webfaction
* Heroku (Flask, Django)
* VPS running a WSGI server like uWSGI or gunicorn.
