'''<dfn>Python</dfn>''' is a programming language and web server runtime environment used for many IndieWeb [[projects]].

== Libraries == 

Generally useful libraries being developed by IndieWeb participants in Python.

* [[ronkyuu]], a collection of tools for sending webmentions and verifying rel=me.
* [https://github.com/vrypan/webmention-tools webmention-tools], utilities to send webmentions and query [[Webmention.io]]
* [https://github.com/tommorris/mf2py mf2py], a microformats2 parser 
** Bleeding-edge development currently being done on [https://github.com/KartikPrabhu/mf2py Kartik's fork]. Will be folded into the master in the future.
* [[mf2util]] is a microformats2-specific parsing utility. Useful for reading the relevant properties for comments and reply-contexts. Also has some special handling for date/times that converts them into Python datetime or date objects.

=== Third-party Libraries ===

Non-IndieWeb-specific libraries that may still be of interest.

* [http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/ Requests]: By far the best way to interact with any HTML endpoint.
* [http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/ BeautifulSoup4]: sits of top of other HTML parsing libraries (lxml or html5lib) and provides a nice interface for wading through HTML, even horribly broken HTML.
* [http://bleach.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ Bleach]: sanitizer and autolinker. Useful for removing dangerous code from e.g., for displaying remote content. Excludes almost everything by default.

== Projects ==

== Hosting ==

Python does not have PHP's ubiquity, and finding hosting can be a little bit more of a challenge. See [[web_hosting]] for more details.

* Google AppEngine (webapp, Django)
* Webfaction
* Heroku (Flask, Django)
* VPS running a WSGI server like uWSGI or gunicorn.
