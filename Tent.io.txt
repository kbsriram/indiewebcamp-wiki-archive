== Monoculture ==
Tent.io has been pitched (no pun intended) as a single project distributed social network solution: <blockquote>Tent is decentralized, not federated or centralized. Any Tent server can connect to any other Tent server.</blockquote>[https://tent.io/blog/introducing-tent]

Anything pitched as a <em>single project</em> by name, e.g. "'''Tent server''' can connect to any other '''Tent server'''" ['''emphasis''' added] is likely to inevitably descend into a [[monoculture]].

== Criticism ==
=== Poor Community Handling ===
<blockquote>@graue the sad thing is, I'm kind of on my way to taking a pause from Tent like you're doing because of how they handle the community :-(</blockquote>[https://twitter.com/jeena/status/391314265258610688]

=== Shadow Web ===
<blockquote>@jeena that devs should target Twitter use-case specifically not make do-everything protocols. Also feel Tent creates a shadow web, failing</blockquote>[https://twitter.com/graue/status/391327938588577792]

=== Dropped support for own domain ===
<blockquote>it died for me after a update where I wasn't able to use my [[own domain]]/server anymore[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-08/line/1399583260] ... the devs told me that this is not a priority for them, and now, 6 months later it still hasn't been fixed[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-08/line/1399583299]</blockquote>
