= note =
A '''<dfn>note</dfn>''' is a [[post]] that is typically short, plain text, and written/posted quickly.

Displaying an individual note (tweet/status update) on its own permalink page is a common pattern.

== Documented Examples ==
* [[User:waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] has a collection of annotated screenshots [http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/photos/tags-note/list here], including examples from:
** Facebook (Web UI)
** Twitter (Web, Mac App)
** waterpigs.co.uk
** aaronparecki.com
** tantek.com

== Common Aspects ==
There are certain UI elements which are common to most implementations. These include:

* Profile photo (often with rounded corners)
* Full Name (often emboldened)
* Auto–linked URLs, usernames and #tags
* Dates (sometimes relative, almost always the option to see real date)

=== Autolinking and embedding ===
Various sites/solutions auto-link and/or auto-embed URLs and other linkable things in notes.

recommendations:
* auto-link URLs directly
** even better: if the URL is to a known person, use their name as the link text and perhaps include a small icon of their face before their name.
* auto-link @-names to Twitter profiles
** even better: auto-link @-names to individual's indieweb sites and show their full name instead of Twitter handle. Obviously keep @-names in note content when POSSEing to Twitter.
* auto-embed GIF/JPG/PNG URLs with &lt;img src>, hyperlinked to the original
* auto-embed MOV/OGV URLs with &lt;video src>, hyperlinked to the original
* auto-embed Youtube URLs with the equivalent Youtube &lt;iframe src> embed (algorithmically convertible)
You can use the [[CASSIS]] <code>auto_link</code> function to do all the above (except the "even better" enhancements) automatically to a piece of plain text.

avoid:
* auto-linking URLs through URLs shorteners (please don't break the web)
* cluttering image/video embeds with extra text (e.g. name/title from destination)

Compare for example:
* '''good original note''': http://tantek.com/2013/054/t2/future-dystopia-beijing-blade-runner
** with autolinked/embedded URLs/images in context of their content location
* '''worse Twitter handling of POSSE'd copy''': https://twitter.com/t/status/305570846796312577
** link shortener wrapping of links
** clumsier image embed - after all tweet text content
** smaller image embed
** undesired extra text
** external site name
** user interface buttons between tweet text and image embed

== Less Common Aspects ==
* username/nickname - as well as the full name, there’s often a silo-specific nickname/alias
* URL to their indieweb home page
* posting application/tool
* posting location - aka geo

==== Location ====
[[Location]] (AKA <span id="Geo">[[Geo]]</span>) of notes is somewhat rare and not very well done. Nonetheless, there are questions, use-cases, and examples.

===== IndieWeb Thoughts =====
Questions:
* What's the point of posting a note/tweet with location information? (one that's not a checkin)
** What does it do for me (as the user posting it)?
** And what does it do for people reading my notes/tweets? 
** Why is it interesting/useful to anyone?

Related but different: [[checkins]], [[events]], [[photos]] with location.

Use-cases for posting geo / post location information with notes:
* '''location specific service provider help'''
** https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/320597741485051904
*** "Included there because I wanted @O2IRL to know I was in Ireland"
* '''meetup in non-home city''' - specifically expressing being in the same (non-home) city
** https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/311161906809421824
* '''explicit I'm not home''' - indication of being in a non-home city
**  https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/316667682877497344 because I was out of town
* '''"help!"''' if you're in trouble - geolocating it would be useful
**  uncommon but urgent use-case.
** though in a "help" situation it's faster to simply *type* where you are etc. than wait for geo location information to come-up, confirm, etc.
*** because geo information is so often "invisible" - it requires extra UI steps to make it work = extra time = not going to do it in an emergency
*** worse - devices get geo information wrong all the time - and having it be wrong in an emergency would be particularly bad
** basically, lack of trust for device geo = not going to use it in a help situation
* if you '''don't know where you are and need help''', then some (even possibly error-prone) geo information may be better than nothing
** but now we're talking quite a bit of an edge case.

===== Twitter tweet with location =====
Live example:
* https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/276466935372341248

Problems:
* '''artificial precision''' - Twitter in particular links names of cities like "Paris, Paris" <nowiki>[sic]</nowiki> to a Google map with lat/long of 8 decimal digits precision!
** e.g. https://twitter.com/aaronpk/status/276466935372341248 <blockquote>I didn't mean "x,y" I meant "Paris" - aaronpk on [[IRC]]</blockquote>

Past Example when Twitter used to show a map on tweet permalinks of the location:

== White space ==
Typical [[silo]] notes implementations display most whitespace written in their posting interfaces. E.g.
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] status updates are notes (no post title) that preserve sequential space characters and line breaks.
=== Google ===
[[Google+]] posts are similarly just notes (no post title) that also preserve sequential space characters and line breaks.
=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] now has multiple implementations that preserve white space characters in presentation:
* '''Twitter.com''' (as of ~2013-03-13)[http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57574167-93/twitter-adds-line-breaks-and-gets-hit-with-the-ugly-stick/][http://mashable.com/2013/03/13/twitter-line-breaks/][http://www.digitaltrends.com/social-media/twitter-linebreaks/][http://smallbiztrends.com/2013/03/twitter-line-breaks.html][http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/14/what-are-twitter-line-breaks-good-for/]
** e.g. https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies/status/4809602603
** based on a test ( [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 18:13, 15 April 2013 (PDT) ), when posting to Twitter.com, Twitter's server
*** preserves simple linebreaks
*** preserves multiple spaces between words
*** preserves spaces at the start of a line
*** but collapses multiple linebreaks into a maximum of one blank line between lines.
* '''Twitter iOS client''' (previously: Tweetie)

Encoding - analysis of the above tweet:
* View Source: The linebreaks are encoded as <code>&amp;#10;</code> character entitites, without any visible line breaks in the code.
* View Selection Source (FF) and Inspect Element (FF, Safari): The linebreaks appear to be simple "carriage return" characters (<code>\r</code>, ASCII 13), showing visible line breaks in the code.
* In either case, the visual presentation of the whitespace characters is achieved using CSS: <blockquote style="white-space:pre"><code><nowiki>.js-tweet-text {
    white-space: pre-wrap;
}</nowiki></code></blockquote>

=== Indieweb thinking ===
Due to the expectations set by dominant [[silo]] implementations, any note authoring/composing UI should preserve  line-breaks, blank lines, and multiple space characters when writing/authoring, displaying/presenting, and ideally, when syndicating ([[POSSE]]).

Especially now that even Twitter has set consistent expectations from its posting UI, there's a strong case that a user switching from Twitter to an indieweb note posting UI would expect whitespace and linebreaks to "just work".

Obviously indieweb implementations would have to preserve white-space in posting UI to storage to display round-trips. Then in the presentation they could either:
* a. '''&lt;br/> substitutions''' - Indieweb implementations could (are any already?) automatically insert <code>&lt;br></code> tags for linebreak whitespaces (similarly to auto-linking URLs in notes). But this wouldn't handle multiple sequential space characters.
* b. '''white-space:pre-wrap''' - Alternatively (preferably) indieweb implementations should use <code>white-space:pre-wrap</code> similar to how Twitter does.

Thus b. white-space:pre-wrap seems to be the logical choice for indieweb implementations.

=== Indieweb implementations ===
* '''tantek.com''' [[Falcon]] [[notes]] as of 2013-105 (retroactively supported in storage & styling back to 2013-001) preserve whitespace, present it, and [[POSSE]] it to [[Twitter]] which then preserves the whitespace when copying it to [[Facebook]], e.g.:
** Original post: http://tantek.com/2013/105/t1/thoughts-boston-finished-deadline-whitespace-falcon
** POSSE tweet with linebreaks: https://twitter.com/t/status/323994155690909699
** Tweet copy to FB with linebreaks: https://www.facebook.com/tantek.celik/posts/10100581192582203
* ...

=== Use Cases ===
There are some interesting use cases to preserving white space, in particular line breaks. 

Besides the obvious use-cases of poetry, paragraphs, and lists, there is for example, chess games (and moves!)

* https://twitter.com/alapapa/status/312053522755641344

This leads us to the use case of '''indieweb spectator [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_chess correspondence chess]'''. That is, two players could play a chess game just by posting moves on their own indieweb sites as replies to each others' moves.

Perhaps chess moves (and resulting board state) could be posted as a special kind of [[note]] [[post]] type (a game-move or game-turn?) and then [[POSSE]]'d to Twitter with whitespace intact. 

If the move is response to a move on another indiewebsite, then in addition to using [[webmention]] for move completion notification, the POSSE'd response move could also indicate with Twitter's in-reply-to-status-id the POSSE'd tweet of the previous move. See [[comment#POSSE_a_comment|how to POSSE a comment]]/[[in-reply-to]]/[[rel-syndication]] for details of how to do this.

Such public posting of moves would also allow for anyone to jump in and attempt to play a next move by posting a reply move. The player of the previous move would then receive multiple webmentions and could decided which move (or both) to reply to in turn.

== Subtypes ==
Since notes are such a ubiquitous content posting type (Thanks to [[Twitter]]), it's no surprise that subtypes of notes are evolving for representing additional structure or types of information. Let's document them as they emerge.

== Note Display ==
When displaying a note, it is customary to just display the note content and no explicit note title.

While this is fairly straightforward for a site itself (which often has its own post type information, perhaps even as an additional class name on the h-entry like <code>h-as-note</code>), for sites that display [[h-entry]]s from elsewhere it helps to have an algorithm to determining when is a note a note and should thus be displayed as such.

=== Note Type Algorithm ===
Summary: if the name of the h-entry is essentially the content of the entry, it's a note, just display the content (and no explicit name/title).

Algorithm for a parsed [[h-entry]]

* set the tname to trim(name)
* set the tcontent to trim(content)
* if the tname == tcontent, then it's a note, return.
* if the tname ends with an ellipsis ("..." or "…") then 
** drop the ellipsis character
** if the tname is a prefix of tcontent, then it's a note, return
* otherwise it's not a note

== FAQ ==
Questions about notes, implementing them, publishing them.
=== markdown or plain text ===
Q: As an implementer of notes on my own website, should I store [[markdown]] or just plain text and autolink/autoembed everything?

A: Typical implementations store '''plain text''' for notes and use an autolinker/embedder to create links and embedded images. E.g.:
* [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] on [http://tantek.com tantek.com] uses [[Falcon]] which stores all notes as plain text entry-content inside an h-entry in a flat file.
* ... add your implementation example here.

See also: [[storage]].

=== how long should notes be ===
Q: As an implementer, what's the maximum size I should allow for notes?

A: Up to you and your own site needs! Typical implementations do not have note length limitations.
* [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] on [http://tantek.com tantek.com] uses [[Falcon]] which has no explicit lenght limitation on notes, however as part of the publishing UI shows what will be [[POSSE]]d to Twitter and how many characters are remaining to do so without having to elide the text.
* ... add your implementation example here.

=== how to display in a list  ===
Q: When displaying a list of [[h-entry]] notes, e.g. in [[comments-presentation]] on a post, or in an indie [[reader]], when should the name, or name+content, or just content be displayed?

A: See [[notes#Note_Display|notes display]] for how to determine when to use a name or name+content and what to display accordingly.
