A '''<dfn>draft</dfn>''' in the context of the indieweb refers to a draft <em>[[post]]</em>, a post that an author has partially written, or otherwise does not consider finished.

== Why ==
Drafts are useful for private or semi-public sharing with others for review and feedback before official publication and [[POSSE]]ing.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Some IndieWeb community members are using [[scheduling]] to publish drafts at otherwise public URLs, but not have them show up on their [[homepage]] (e.g. in their [[composite stream]]) or legacy [[feed file]].

== Open Source Examples ==
=== WordPress ===
[[WordPress]] has a draft feature that allows you to save a draft and share a URL to a draft post which does not show up on your home page or any feeds.
