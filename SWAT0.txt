'''<dfn><abbr>SWAT0</abbr></dfn>''' is an abbreviation for The Social Web Acid Test level 0 and is an user-feature interoperability test for social web functionality defined in 2010.

See the [http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/federatedsocialweb/wiki/SWAT0 description of SWAT0 on W3.org].

== Brainstorming ==
Let's try to rephrase the SWAT0 test in IndieWeb terminology, referring to people's own websites rather than "social network" services.
