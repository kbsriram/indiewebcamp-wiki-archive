'''<dfn>idno</dfn>''' is an open publishing / community platform [[project]] currently being developed in public [https://github.com/idno on GitHub].

Goals: easy to install, use and customize, and which adheres to IndieWeb [[building-blocks|technologies]] and [[principles]]. 

Stable release: will be made from [http://idno.co idno.co] later in 2013. 

[[User:benwerd.com|Ben Werdmuller]] is hoping to work with third-party [[web hosting|hosting providers]] to make it easy for users to get an idno site that is both turnkey and fully under their control.

idno has a full plugin architecture, making use of PHP lazy loading and the observer pattern. This makes it very easy to create new content types or behaviors. Documentation for included endpoints are forthcoming.

It also includes many existing IndieWeb libraries published by many in the community, as well as Ben's own Bonita templating engine.

idno is being developed with the rule that "indie" content - internal posts, likes, etc - are bundled as included plugins in the main source code repository. If you want to [[POSSE]] to external sites, you need to install those plugins separately (although they may also be included in a downloadable distribution of the content).

Currently, content includes:

* Posts ([[articles]])
* Status updates ([[notes]])
* [[Photos]] (images)
* Events ([[events]])
* [[Checkins]] (places)
* Chickens (chickens)
** Chickens were demonstrated at the [[2013]] camp but have not been made available as a plugin.

Supported [[webmention]] annotations include:

* [[Replies]]
* [[Likes]]
* Reshares
* [[RSVPs]]

idno also has a [[Webfinger]] endpoint that plugins can extend.

=== IndieFriends ===

idno is designed to be a multi-user system (although Ben is currently using it as a single-user site). The intention, therefore, is to implement a traditional asymmetrical social networking friends / following model - with an IndieWeb spin.

* Each user will have a following page, with [[h-card|h-cards]] marked up using [[XFN]] links to each followed user's [[profile]].
* When User A starts following User B, an appropriate link is made on the following page. A [[WebMention]] is sent with the source set to User A's following page, and the target set to User B's [[profile]] page.
* User B's system notifies User B, who can react accordingly.
* Ideally, this is then attached to a reader component. See below ...

In a future embodiment, each step in the webmention process could be signed on a per-user basis (I'm interested in [[HTTP signatures]], with keys exchanged / assigned at the point of mention. This would allow content to be made privately available to individual users. Other methods of retrieving private web content should also be considered.

=== Reader! ===

Because it's not enough to publish: a way to _consume_ IndieWeb content from an idno user's followed sites and users.
