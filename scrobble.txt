A '''<dfn>scrobble</dfn>''' (AKA a <dfn>listen</dfn>) is a [[passive]] type of [[post]] used to publish a song (music or audio track) that you have listened to.

'''<dfn>scrobbling</dfn>''' is the act of passively publishing scrobbles.

The term "scrobble" comes from [[Last.fm]]'s software, Audioscrobbler.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Michael Owens ===
{{mko}} has imported all 76,000 of his past [[Last.fm]] listens to his site. He can post them manually to his site as well as [[PESOS]] them from Last.fm. Example:
* https://mowens.com/data/2014/10/16/1/take-me-to-church-album-version

Details:
* '''Musicbrainz ID'''. Each of the data elements has a p-* with the Musicbrainz ID of the various Tracks and Albums where it's available.
*  '''Album images'''.  <blockquote>It annoyed me that Last.fm served images without HTTPS, so I cached the imagery for every track. I need to run a checksum comparison of images to remove duplicate files at some point.</blockquote>

== Open Source ==
=== Libre.fm and GNU FM ===
There exists https://libre.fm which uses [http://www.gnu.org/software/gnufm GNU FM]. Once could conceivably run this on their own site.

== Brainstorming ==
=== IndieWeb Scrobbling ===

Creating an IndieWeb implementation of a [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scrobble scrobbling] ''server'' or pass-through relay would free data about one's music listening activity and history from the Last.fm silo. One would scrobble tracks to their own personal server before syndicating the activity to other social sites like Last.fm.  All of the scrobbling activity would be archived in a database on one's personal web server. A simple implementation need only implement the basic functionality present in the [http://www.last.fm/api/show?service=443 Last.fm API] such that existing Last.fm client software could be used with minimal modification.

=== Ideas for advanced features ===
Scrobbling activity could be syndicated in other formats (i.e. Activity Streams), or published in another form altogether such as a tweet or status update. 

Scrobbling activity could be filtered prior to syndication. For example, before publishing a track, the software could first check the artist and/or track name is not present in a list of "guilty pleasures."
