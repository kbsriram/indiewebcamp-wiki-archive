'''<dfn>[http://tumblr.com Tumblr]</dfn>''' is a popular content hosting [[silo]], and through domain mapping, a content hosting service as well.

== How to ==
=== POSSE to Tumblr ===
Tumblr used to be able to import an RSS feed (dates? citations?).

How are people POSSEing to Tumblr today? Presumably using their API? Or email?

==== POSSE Reposts of Tumblr posts ====
When posting a [[repost]] of a Tumblr post, the proper POSSE behavior should be to do a native repost (on Tumblr) of the post that you're reposting on your own site.

IndieWeb community members doing this:
* acegiak is doing this as of 2014-050 per claim[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-02-19/line/1392813763]
** Example of original repost: [http://acegiak.machinespirit.net/2014/02/20/john-greens-tumblr-nevverjorge-luis-borges/]
** Example of POSSE repost on Tumblr: [http://acegiak.tumblr.com/post/77227657347/nevver-jorge-luis-borges-this-is-a-lesson-i]

'''Considerations:'''
Reblogging specifically has to be done through the [http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2|tumblrapi] which requires oauth and cannot be done through their email posting service. This is because posting a reblog requires the system to first api fetch the original post that is being reblogged to get it's "reblog_key" that must be sent with it's post id when making the reblog call.

==== POSSE Reposts to Tumblr ====
When you do a [[repost]] of an indieweb post:
* look for a [[rel-syndication]] hyperlink on the indieweb post permalink page to a Tumblr.com post URL
* if there is such a [[rel-syndication]] hyperlink with href linking to a Tumblr.com post URL
* then
** do a native repost of that Tumblr post URL on Tumblr itself
* end if

==== POSSE Favorites of Tumblr posts ====
When posting a [[favorite]] of a Tumblr post, the proper POSSE behavior should be to natively "like" (on Tumblr) the Tumblr post that you're favoriting on your own site.

==== POSSE Favorites to Tumblr ====
When you post a [[favorite]] of an indieweb post:
* look for a [[rel-syndication]] hyperlink on the indieweb post permalink page to a Tumblr.com post URL
* if there is such a [[rel-syndication]] hyperlink with href linking to a Tumblr post URL
* then
** natively "like" that Tumblr post URL on Tumblr itself
* end if

=== Add rel-me links and use IndieAuth ===

On your Tumblr page, click the Customize button, then add [[rel-me]] links as HTML directly in the Description section. [http://www.scottbuehler.com/social-media/ultimate-guide-google-authorship/#tumblrauthor More details.]


=== Add microformats support ===
Tumblr has documentation on [http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes How to create a custom HTML theme] which you can use to add [[microformats]] support, especially [[h-entry]] and [[h-card]].

# Go to your Tumblr URL, e.g. yourname.tumblr.com
# Click the "Customize" link/button with the wrench icon (usually in top right)
# Click the (Edit HTML) button
# add [[h-entry]]
## scroll down and find all instances of <code>&lt;div class="post"&gt;</code>
## change them to <code>&lt;div class="post h-entry"&gt;</code>
## scroll down and find all instances of <code>&lt;div class="date_brick"&gt;</code>
## change them to <code>&lt;div class="date_brick dt-published"&gt;</code>
## you may need to update their contents to publish the date and time in ISO format, using the value class pattern etc. These macros may help with that: {Year}-{MonthNumberWithZero}-{DayOfMonthWithZero} {24HourWithZero}:{Minutes}:{Seconds}
## href="{Permalink}"
## to: class="u-url" href="{Permalink}"
## ... more coming soon (p-name, e-content)

==== Example Tumblrs with microformats ====
The following Tumblrs have proper [[h-entry]] markup (per the above instructions) and thus may help as examples:
* http://tantek.tumblr.com/  (also uses <code>&lt;link rel=author&gt;</code> for site and post [[authorship]])
* ...

=== Export ===
Tumblr's v1 read API is blissfully simple to use although now deprecated. It returns custom XML but it is fairly straightforward to transform this into HTML etc.

See [http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v1 documentation].

[[User:Tommorris.org|tommorris]] ported most of his content over from Tumblr.

== PESETAS ==
Getting data out of Tumblr is pretty easy as documented above. There is no need to get or use API keys or OAuth tokens or anything.

This makes Tumblr a logical destination silo for a [[PESETAS]] setup.

== Feeds ==
Public feeds are available of Tumblr sites at the path "/rss", e.g.:
* http://tantek.tumblr.com/rss

== Porting to the IndieWeb ==
=== Challenges ===
* porting over content and maintaining URL redirects
* porting over comments
* porting over reblogs
* porting over likes

=== Export Your Posts ===
* The Tumblr API provides XML and JSON for posts. The v1 API doesn't require authentication. [http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v1 documentation]
* ...

==== Mapping of Tumblr post types to ActivityStreams ====
Tumblr posts can be roughly mapped to [[ActivityStreams]] object types as follows:

; text : note or article (depending on length)
; quote : ???
; photo : image
; chat : ???
; video : video
; audio : audio
