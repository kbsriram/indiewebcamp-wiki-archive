'''<dfn>[http://tumblr.com Tumblr]</dfn>''' is a popular content hosting [[silo]], and through domain mapping, a content hosting service as well.

== How to ==
=== POSSE to Tumblr ===
Tumblr used to be able to import an RSS feed (dates? citations?).

How are people POSSEing to Tumblr today? Presumably using their API? Or email?

==== POSSE Reposts of Tumblr posts ====
When posting a [[repost]] of a Tumblr post, the proper POSSE behavior should be to do a native repost (on Tumblr) of the post that you're reposting on your own site.

IndieWeb community members doing this:
* acegiak is doing this as of 2014-050 per claim[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-02-19/line/1392813763]
** Example of original repost: [http://acegiak.machinespirit.net/2014/02/20/john-greens-tumblr-nevverjorge-luis-borges/]
** Example of POSSE repost on Tumblr: [http://acegiak.tumblr.com/post/77227657347/nevver-jorge-luis-borges-this-is-a-lesson-i]

'''Considerations:'''
Reblogging specifically has to be done through the [http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2|tumblrapi] which requires oauth and cannot be done through their email posting service. This is because posting a reblog requires the system to first api fetch the original post that is being reblogged to get it's "reblog_key" that must be sent with it's post id when making the reblog call.

==== POSSE Reposts to Tumblr ====
When you do a [[repost]] of an indieweb post:
* look for a [[rel-syndication]] hyperlink on the indieweb post permalink page to a Tumblr.com post URL
* if there is such a [[rel-syndication]] hyperlink with href linking to a Tumblr.com post URL
* then
** do a native repost of that Tumblr post URL on Tumblr itself
* end if

==== POSSE Favorites of Tumblr posts ====
When posting a [[favorite]] of a Tumblr post, the proper POSSE behavior should be to natively "like" (on Tumblr) the Tumblr post that you're favoriting on your own site.

==== POSSE Favorites to Tumblr ====
When you post a [[favorite]] of an indieweb post:
* look for a [[rel-syndication]] hyperlink on the indieweb post permalink page to a Tumblr.com post URL
* if there is such a [[rel-syndication]] hyperlink with href linking to a Tumblr post URL
* then
** natively "like" that Tumblr post URL on Tumblr itself
* end if

=== Add rel-me links and use IndieAuth ===

On your Tumblr page, click the Customize button, then add [[rel-me]] links as HTML directly in the Description section. [http://www.scottbuehler.com/social-media/ultimate-guide-google-authorship/#tumblrauthor More details.]

You can use this snippet to do so:
<pre><code>
{block:Description}
<meta name="description" content="{MetaDescription}" />
-<a href=" --Link to Site Goes Here--" rel="me">--Site Name Goes Here--</a>
{/block:Description}
</code>
</pre>

=== Add microformats support ===
Tumblr has documentation on [http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/custom_themes How to create a custom HTML theme] which you can use to add [[microformats]] support, especially [[h-entry]] and [[h-card]].

There is a [https://gist.github.com/tallus/43e09af02cbad58534a4  indie web version theme] already marked up that you can use. Click on the customize link and copy and paste this over the existing html.

# Go to your Tumblr URL, e.g. yourname.tumblr.com
# Click the "Customize" link/button with the wrench icon (usually in top right)
# Click the (Edit HTML) button
# add [[h-entry]]
## scroll down and find all instances of <code>&lt;article class="single_post"&gt;
</code>
## change them to <code>&lt;article class="single_post h-entry"&gt;</code>
## scroll down and find all instances of <code>class="post_date"</code>
## change them to <code>&lt;div class="post_date dt-published"&gt;</code>
## you may need to update their contents to publish the date and time in ISO format, using the value class pattern etc. These macros may help with that: {Year}-{MonthNumberWithZero}-{DayOfMonthWithZero} {24HourWithZero}:{Minutes}:{Seconds}
##  change href="{Permalink}" to: class="u-url" href="{Permalink}"
##  change href="{permalink}" to: class="u-url" href="{permalink}"

You can use the Link feature of Tumblr to send indieweb replies:

Find the section starting block:Link and change it so it looks like this. 
<pre>

{block:Link}
<article class="single_post_wrap">
    
    <article class="single_post h-entry">   

        {block:Date}  
        <h3 class="post_date dt-published">{TimeAgo}</h3>
        {/block:Date} 

                 
        <h2><a class="u-in-reply-to" href="{URL}">{Name}</a></h2>
   
        {block:Description} 
        <div class="description e-content" >{Description}</div>                                                                                                  
        {/block:Description}

</pre>

To reply to something copy the URL and make it a tumblr link.
You will need to manually send webmentions or sign up for [[Brid.gy]]

You can also mark up your photos and photosets with microformats.

Look for <code>img src="{PhotoURL-500}" alt="{PhotoAlt}"</code> and change it to: <code>img class="u-photo" src="{PhotoURL-500}" alt="{PhotoAlt}"</code>
.

==== Example Tumblrs with microformats ====
The following Tumblrs have proper [[h-entry]] markup (per the above instructions) and thus may help as examples:
* http://tantek.tumblr.com/  (also uses <code>&lt;link rel=author&gt;</code> for site and post [[authorship]])
* http://andthenitcametotheend.tumblr.com/ uses the [https://gist.github.com/tallus/43e09af02cbad58534a4 indieweb tumblr theme] mentioned above.

=== Add webmention support ===
Tumblr doesn't have built in support for [[webmention]]s, but [[Bridgy]] can send, receive, and display webmentions for Tumblr blogs. You can also receive webmentions with [[webmention.io]] and [https://webmention.herokuapp.com/ webmention.herokuapp.com].

=== Export ===
Tumblr's v1 read API is blissfully simple to use although now deprecated. It returns custom XML but it is fairly straightforward to transform this into HTML etc.

See [http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v1 documentation].

[[User:Tommorris.org|tommorris]] ported most of his content over from Tumblr.

== PESETAS ==
Getting data out of Tumblr is pretty easy as documented above. There is no need to get or use API keys or OAuth tokens or anything.

This makes Tumblr a logical destination silo for a [[PESETAS]] setup.

== Feeds ==
Public feeds are available of Tumblr sites at the path "/rss", e.g.:
* http://tantek.tumblr.com/rss

== Porting to the IndieWeb ==
=== Challenges ===
* porting over content and maintaining URL redirects
* porting over comments
* porting over reblogs
* porting over likes

=== Export Your Posts ===
* The Tumblr API provides XML and JSON for posts. The v1 API doesn't require authentication. [http://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v1 documentation]
* ...

==== Mapping of Tumblr post types to ActivityStreams ====
Tumblr posts can be roughly mapped to [[ActivityStreams]] object types as follows:

; text : note or article (depending on length)
; quote : ???
; photo : image
; chat : ???
; video : video
; audio : audio

== Downtime ==
* 2010-340 16:24:41-0800 (PST) "issue in ... [[database]] cluster" [http://www.flickr.com/photos/tantek/5331910087/ http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5046/5331910087_c25749d90b_z.jpg]
