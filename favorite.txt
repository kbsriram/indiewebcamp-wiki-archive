A '''<dfn>favorite</dfn>''' is a common [[webaction]] on many [[silos]] (like [[Flickr]], [[Twitter]]), typically visually indicated with a star symbol that fills in with a color when activated (pink, orange). A favorite is similar to but somewhat different from a [[like]].

== Similarity to Like ==
Favorites are similar to likes in how they're represented in some systems.

Similarities:
* number of (favorites/likes) shown on posts ([[Facebook]], [[Flickr]], [[Instagram]], [[Twitter]])
* shows up in a feed of your activities viewable by your friends/followers ([[Facebook]], [[Twitter]])
* ...

__TOC__
== Differences From Like ==
There's some anecdotal evidence that users consider "likes" different from "favorites".

Also they seem to behave differently across systems:

Likes:
* icons: thumbs-up ([[Facebook]]), heart ([[Instagram]])
* means: props/compliments to the original post/poster
* presumed lightweight
* activating increments a count (nearly) immediately (Facebook, Instagram)
* only one instance of browsable likes as a set ([[Instagram]], and those only by the liker).

Favorites:
* icon: star, changes when activated (fills in with a color: pink (Flickr), orange (Twitter))
* means: special to the favoriter
* implies adding to a collection - favorites are always browsable (typically publicly) as a set (e.g. your Flickr Favorites, Twitter Favorites)
* curating

These differences may be subtle enough as to make it confusing if both were present in a system - there are no known systems that have both.

== Silo Examples ==
=== Flickr ===
[[Flickr]] puts a star favorite button on a photo, clicking it puts that photo into your "Favorites" collection/album, and adds to the favorite count (and list of favoriters) of that photo.

=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] puts a star favorite button under each tweet that adds it to your Favorites collection.

== FAQ ==
=== Do both or not ===
Q: Should I have both favorite and like posts?

A: Why?

Do you want to use both favorite and like? if so, how do they differ to you?

If not, just pick one and use that. The difference has been discussed quite a bit here, and trivial differences documented above: [[favorite#Differences_From_Like|Differences from like]].
