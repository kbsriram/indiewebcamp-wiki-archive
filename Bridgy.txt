'''<dfn>[https://www.brid.gy/ Bridgy]</dfn>''' is an open source [[project]] and proxy that implements [[backfeed]] as a service.  Bridgy sends [[webmentions]] for [[comments]], [[like]]s, etc. on [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Google+]], and [[Instagram]]. 

== How to use ==
[[File:bridgy-logo.jpg|200px|right]]

Once you OAuth into Brid.gy with your Facebook/Twitter/Google+/Instagram identities, Bridgy polls your posts on each respectively, discovers original post links, and sends comments to those links as webmentions to your webmention endpoint (discovered from the original post links).

It also serves the [[silo]] posts, comments, likes, etc. as [[microformats2]] for webmention targets to read.

__TOC__

== Why ==
=== Backfeed ===
Bridgy is the fastest way to implement [[backfeed]] on your site.

Once you have [[webmention]] receiving support implemented on your indieweb site, OAuth into Bridgy and it will send webmentions to your posts for any activity on [[POSSE]]d copies of those posts on [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Google+]], and [[Instagram]].

=== Send silo interactions ===
After you sign up, Bridgy sends all responses to your posts back to your site. In addition, it sends some of your responses - currently only favorites on Twitter - to other sites that support webmentions. The recipients don't need to be signed up themselves; Bridgy sends webmentions to any server that supports them.

If you favorite things directly on Twitter, then be sure to sign up so your favorites are propagated as well as other people's favorites on your tweets.

== Implementation details ==

[https://www.brid.gy/about More implementation details here.]

=== Generating h-cards from silo profiles ===
If your silo profile includes your web site URL, it's included in the h-card that Bridgy generates instead of your silo profile URL, which means that Bridgy comments rendered on original posts will (usually) link directly to your web site. As an example, see
the [https://snarfed.org/2014-03-01_indiewebcamp-sf-next-weekend#comments second and third comments here].

This is another step toward making individual web sites the real UX and using silos just as invisible infrastructure (pubsub, friend graphs, etc).

=== Custom Facebook [[original-post-discovery]] ===
Facebook supports POSSEing with [[POSSE_to_Facebook#See_Original|custom "See Original" links]]. Bridgy detects these and correctly sends comments and likes to the linked post.

=== [[posse-post-discovery]] on content with no backlinks ===
As of 2014-04-26, Bridgy uses posse-post-discovery to find original posts, even when the syndicated post does not or cannot include a permalink/citation. (as long as users publish rel-syndication links on their own site).

== FAQ ==
=== What about links posted by others ===
'''Q:''' Could Bridgy send notifications for links to your site posted by others? E.g. 
* https://twitter.com/benwerd/status/451165922418388992
is effectively a comment on:
* http://kartikprabhu.com/article/indieweb-love-blog
And it would be handy to receive it as such.

Some indieweb sites have forms which allow this manually, like [[User:Adactio.com|Jeremy Keith]], e.g. this post:
* http://adactio.com/journal/6663/
where every "comment" 
* http://adactio.com/journal/6663/#comment501
is there because the tweet URL that linked to it was pasted into Adactio's form and submitted manually.

'''A:''' The difficult part about implementing this is identifying the original author's POSSEd (syndicated) tweet so it can be omitted. [[rel-syndication]] links help, but not many people actually use them yet.
More discussion in these two GitHub issues:
* [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/6 #6: check original posts for rel-syndication links]
* [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/51 #51: send webmentions for original POSSE silo posts]

Follow-ups:
* There should be no need to omit POSSE'd posts as implementations should be able to handle receiving webmentions of those anyway, since anyone can curl one manually.
* See also [[original-post-discovery]] and please document any examples or issues with going from a POSSE'd post to the original there (e.g. actual URLs of POSSE'd posts that were difficult to use to find the original).

Another example:
* https://twitter.com/gRegorLove/status/455731644167491585 is a comment/repost on: http://bret.io/2014/03/29/nardwuar/
** The tweet is a silo-only status; it was not POSSE from my site.
** I did attempt to manually send a webmention to bret, but it failed to find the source URL do to http://t.co link wrapping.
** Technically the original tweet fits the description of "repost" better than "comment", but there is no way I'm aware of to determine this, since it's a standalone tweet. I presume it should be a generic mention, not an in-reply-to
