<dfn>'''Homebrew Website Club'''</dfn> is a bi-weekly meetup of people passionate about or interested in creating, improving, building, designing their own website, in the same structure as the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] meetings.

== Description ==
Are you building your own website? Indie reader? Personal publishing web app? Or some other digital magic-cloud proxy?

If so, you might like to come to a gathering of people with likeminded interests. Exchange information, swap ideas, talk shop, help work on a project, whatever...

== Meetings ==
Meetings take place '''every other Wednesday right after work, 18:30-19:30'''. If it collides with an official holiday, simply skip that one and resume two weeks later as usual.

See [[events]] for dates/locations/URLs of upcoming meetings!

... start one in your city!

=== Structure ===
* '''17:30-18:30 optional Quiet Writing Hour''': some locations have started hosting a quiet writing hour from 17:30-18:30 immediately before the meetup itself.
* '''18:30-19:30 Homebrew Website Club Meetup''' - two phases and a transition
** '''18:30-19:00: Broadcast''' - take turns with the microphone 1-2 minutes on:
*** if this is your first time, introduce yourself, name, URL, what you'd like to do next with your personal site.
*** something '''new you built''' since the last time you attended
*** '''questions''' about anything you're stuck on '''about your personal site'''
*** '''notable''' indieweb / ownyourdata related '''press''' / events
** '''~19:00: Group photo''' - organizers should call time on the "broadcast" phase and then organize and take a group photo to upload to the wiki and embed in the "Photos" section on the page for the specific event. This also helps break-up existing sitting patterns and gives people a chance to move around.
** '''~19:00-19:30: Peer-to-peer''' - encourage everyone to find others they heard in the previous half hour that were interested in similar topics. Help newcomers with [[getting started]] with their personal sites, and hopefully even logging into the wiki and adding themselves to the RSVP section for the meeting!
* '''~19:45-20:00: Clean-up and meeting closure''' - get everyone to help clean-up and leave the meeting space cleaner than they found it (BarCamp style). Encourage folks to continue discussions at a nearby pub or cafe and get food/drink too!

== History ==
[[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] was inspired after attending the Homebrew Computer Club 38th Reunion and set up the first meeting 2013-11-20 in San Francisco. [http://tantek.com/2013/322/b1/homebrew-computer-club-reunion-inspiration]
