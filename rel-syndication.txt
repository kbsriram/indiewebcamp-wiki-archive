'''<dfn>rel-syndication</dfn>''' is a way to discoverably link from your original blog post permalinks to syndicated copies of it on other sites, e.g. [[silos]].

== Publishing ==
An original post <em>should</em> hyperlink to syndicated copies (e.g. per [[POSSE]]) with a rel value of <code>syndication</code>.

Additionally the [[microformats2]] class name <code>u-syndication</code> should also be placed on such hyperlinks from original posts (inside their [[h-entry]] markup/object) to their syndicated copies.

See the [http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-syndication rel-syndication specification] for more details.

=== Linking to Twitter.com ===

When linking to [[Twitter#POSSE_to_Twitter|POSSEd copies of posts on twitter.com]], make sure the link scheme is <code>https://</code> for [[original-post-discovery]] as Twitter.com redirects to https.

== Use cases ==
{{main|syndication-link-use-cases}}

Why should an original post visibly hyperlink to syndicated copies? 

=== POSSE threading ===
If the Indie Web site supports POSSEing to one or more [[silo]] destinations, it should:
* do rel-syndication discovery on the original [[in-reply-to]] URL
* for each such POSSE destination:
** choose the first rel-syndication link that goes to that destination and save it
* when POSSEing the [[reply]] post to each POSSE destination:
** if a rel-syndication link was found for it
*** be sure to thread the POSSE copy of the reply as a reply to the respective rel-syndication link

== Discovery ==
An Indie Web site that supports the ability to [[reply]] to [[posts]] should allow you to reply to any URL. As part of that reply UI, it should do rel-syndication discovery for the POSSE threading use case described above by following this algorithm:

rel-syndication discovery algorithm:
# load the [[in-reply-to]] URL as a document
# collect all the [[rel-syndication]] <code>link href</code> and <code>a href</code> URLs.
# if none are found,
## parse the document for [[microformats2]]
## if there's a top level [[h-entry]]
## then collect all of its <code>syndication</code> property values 
# end if
# return whatever was collected

Any algorithm that has the same result as this algorithm may be used. E.g. as part of step 2 your code could parse the entire document simultaneously for <em>both</em> <code>rel</code> values and [[h-entry]] microformats rather than the separate parsing step in 3.1.
