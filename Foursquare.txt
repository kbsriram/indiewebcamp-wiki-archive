'''<dfn>[http://foursquare.com Foursquare]</dfn>''' is a location-based [[checkin]] [[silo]] that allows optional posting of a [[photo]] and/or a [[note]] along with a checkin. Photos and notes (as [[comments]]) can also be added to existing checkins. Only the author of the checkin may add photos, but any of their friends may add comments

Checkin notes have a length limitation of 200 characters.

== Event support ==
Foursquare does some amount of tracking of what events are happening at venues in their venue database.

Thus part of their UI provides the user of optionally also checking into a specific [[event]] at a [[venue]], e.g. a particular showing of a movie at a movie theater, or a concert at a music hall.

The result is that others seeing your checkin see that you also checked in at a specific event at the venue, e.g.:

== Venue claiming ==
Foursquare provides the ability for someone officially associated with a venue to "claim" that venue which then gives that person more authority over the venue, including the ability to associate events with the venue (as documented above)

In short:
* someone from the venue has to go to https://foursquare.com/venue/claim
* and claim it as a venue they manage
* they make you give a phone number to "receive a call to verify your claim". The call asks you to record a sentence stating your name and relationship to the venue. The call appears to not be manually screened, but presumably is archived.
* they'll either mail you a postcard, or you can pay $1-20 (depending on city) with a credit card to "verify" it
