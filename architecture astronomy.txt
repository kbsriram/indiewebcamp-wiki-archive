'''<dfn>architecture astronomy</dfn>''' is the practice of analyzing problems, seeing patterns, and then generalizing to higher and higher level abstractions on top of those patterns to the point where the abstractions become so general, so vague, so detached from the original problems being analyzed, that they don't mean anything at all.

'''<dfn>architecture astronauts</dfn>''' are people that have a habit of practicing architecture astronomy, that is, the art of coming up with meaningless abstractions detached from real world problems.
