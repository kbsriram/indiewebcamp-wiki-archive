'''<dfn>giving credit</dfn>''' is a collection of cultural practices related to acknowledging and attributing text, hyperlinks, quotes, utterances to others, typically by name, as a way of recognizing their contribution(s).

Perhaps the most common form of giving credit is directly citing (and linking to, for online source) the source of some text, concepts, or ideas.

=== Via ===
When passing on or repeating text and/or URLs on [[Twitter]] (or [[POSSE]]ed [[notes]]) from a source on Twitter, the person repeating the content often uses "via: " literally in text (without quotes), followed by that person's Twitter @-name, rather than citing the specific tweet.

There are two possible (likely?) reasons for saying "via: @name" instead of <nowiki>"via: https://twitter.com/.../status/...":</nowiki>
* '''It takes less space''' in a tweet to do an @-mention (just the literal number of characters in the @-name plus the @, thus max 17) than a URL (Twitter t.cos http URLs into 22 characters, and https URLs into 23 characters)
* '''Provide an embedded preview for the shared link rather than tweet''' - if you pass on a hyperlink ''and'' also hyperlink to the original tweet, Twitter will show only an embedded preview for the last link in your Tweet, and thus the original tweet rather than the material being passed along.

Alternate syntaxes:
* sometimes "via " (without a ":") is used instead of "via: " to save one character in a tweet.
* a few folks use the slashtag "/via " instead of "via: ". Same number of characters, unconventional punctuation.

== Hat-tip ==
When passing on or repeating text and/or URLs on Twitter from someone who provided the information but not on Twitter (perhaps they spoke it outloud, provided it in IM/[[IRC]] to you, or provided it in some other online source that is lengthier or on another or more general topic), the person repeating the content sometimes uses "hat-tip: " followed by the person's Twitter @-name. More often the abbreviation "ht: " is used to save space.

The same reason(s) as for using "via:" can justify using "ht:" with @-name instead of linking to a permalink or some other sort.

Alternate syntax(es):
* sometimes "ht " (without a ":") is used instead of "ht: " to save one character in a tweet.
* a few folks use the slashtag "/ht " instead of "ht: ". Same number of characters, unconventional punctuation.
