{{stub}}

'''<dfn>notifications</dfn>''' in the context of the IndieWeb refer to all forms and ways that an independent web site can receive a message indicating something of interest (server notifications), and potentially relay that information (preferably in realtime) to one or more devices used by the owner of that site (client notifications).

== Use Cases ==
There are numerous use cases for notifications, this is meant to capture a few that are currently real world and pervasive.

=== Individual ===
* text messages from contacts
* calendar reminders
* alarms

=== Public-like ===
* Amber Alert text messages
* Weather alerts per http://www.nws.noaa.gov/com/weatherreadynation/wea.html
* Sports scores (realtime, e.g. World Cup goals)

== Server Notifications ==
For server notifications, we use [[webmention]]

== Client Notifications ==
Also/often referred to as "push notifications".

For notifications from an indieweb site to a web browser on a device, you may be able to use one or more of the following:

* https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/SimplePush
** Works on FirefoxOS devices and (presumably) the [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Using_the_B2G_desktop_client desktop simulator]

== Projects ==
=== Mention app ===
{{main|mention-app}}
* Aaronpk is working on an iOS app (for now called just [[mention-app]]) to send him push notifications from an [[h-feed]]. Thus, if a server publishes received [[webmentions]] into an h-feed page, the app will get those (hopefully via [[PuSH]], last resort via polling), and propagate them to the user's iOS device.
