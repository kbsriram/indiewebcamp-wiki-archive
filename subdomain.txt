{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>subdomain</dfn>''' typically refers to a [[domain]] with one more "name(dot)" component than that which someone actually has registered which is often seen indieweb sites with a family name domain like joel(dot)franusic(dot)com, or often on [[silos]] like matt(dot)wordpress(dot)com.

Most writing about IndieWeb assumes people will have their own second-level domain, like tantek.com, used just for themselves.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Joel Franusic ===
[[User:joel.example.com|Joel Franusic]] uses joel.example.com as a way to separate given and family names, thus allowing for other subdomains for other Franusic family members.
=== Ben Roberts ===
[[User:ben.thatmustbe.me|Ben Roberts]] uses ben.thatmustbe.me - likely as a "domain hack" that reads as an English sentence.

== Silo Examples ==
The following silos give users subdomains:
* [[Blogger]]
* [[LiveJournal]] (switched from path to subdomain in 2006, read why: [[lj2006]]
* [[Tumblr]]
* [[Withknown.com]]
* [[WordPress.com]]

== Subdomain advantages disadvantags ==
Pro: reduced cost and admin effort

Con: In a hypothetical example of alice.example.com, alice is dependent on example.com, although the dependency can potentially be very small, with example.com just managing a [[DNS]]] "A" record for alice, pointing to alice's server.


== Path alternative ==
Example: http://example.com/alice

Pro: reduced cost and admin effort

Con: alice is locked into example.com; there's no way alice can leave

Con: example.com can't allow alice to host arbitrary content withouth endangering their other users, because of the browser same-origin policy.   (see [[lj2006]] for Livejournal's having to deal with this in 2006.)

=== Silo Path Examples ===
The following silos give paths to users instead of subdomains:
* [[Facebook]]
* [[Instagram]]
* [[Twitter]]

== Conclusion ==

It seems okay to use subdomains as long as the 2nd-level domain holder makes a sufficient guarantee of subdomain portability.  That is, they must let users change their DNS "A" records in perpetuity for no more than a minimal charge.

This seems reasonable with families, and perhaps also with fraternities, colleges, and other organizations to which one naturally has a life-long membership.

At some point, there may be companies willing to offer this kind of service with a plausible very-long-term commitment.

Note that taking advantage of free hosting that offers free subdomains leaves a lot of control of the domain in the hands of the host, putting your url at [http://indiewebcamp.com/why#Why_Indie_Web risk of a whole lot of things].   Similarly, universities, etc, tend to not provide long-term stability.

== Avoid www subdomain ==
Avoid using "www." on your domain.
* It introduces an unnecessary security scoping (see above)
* It's superfluous, per http://no-www.org/

* [[dns]]
* [[personal domain]]
* [[short domain]]
