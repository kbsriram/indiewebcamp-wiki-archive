'''<dfn>Diaspora</dfn>''' (or D*) is an open source [[project]] for hosting a social network on your own server that [[federates]] with other Diaspora instances, which are called "pods".

[[Friendica]] implemented D* federation successfully, although there were some problems with post formats (IIRC D* syndicated markdown but friendica syndicated BB code --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 08:23, 12 July 2013 (PDT)). [[StatusNet]] can subscribe to D* feeds.

== Standards Support ==
Diaspora makes use of several social web standards, including:

* Parts of [[OStatus]]: 
** [[pubsubhubbub]]
** [[activitystreams]]
* [[hCard]]

== Data Export ==
Despite one of D*’s headline features being data portability, this (as of 2013-02) has not been implemented, and the data export features are sorely lacking. Image export does not function at all, and the XML file which can be downloaded only includes contact data, not actual posts.

* Or, at least, that is my experience. This needs to be verified by someone else --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 12:25, 25 February 2013 (PST)

[https://github.com/barnabywalters/diaspora-export diaspora-export], created by [[User:WaterPigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]], is a python script for quickly exporting all of your public posts given only your profile URL. It spits out a JSON file which can then easily be transformed and imported into your own site.

== POSSE support ==
D* can [https://wiki.diasporafoundation.org/Integrating_other_social_networks integrate with other social networks], which is a way of [[POSSE]].

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb community members using Diaspora on their own site.
* none currently.

== Statistics ==
http://podupti.me/ shows stats about current Disapora pods in use 
* notice the exceptionally high amount of pods in DE (e.g. see [[Despora]])

== Criticism ==
=== Monoculture ===
Noted as an [[monoculture#Examples|example on the monoculture page]], but also explicitly noted as a cultural observation in [https://www.loomio.org/d/4Z28QFTn/social-web-working-group-w3c#comment-199202 this comment on a diaspora related forum] regarding, ironically, federation: <blockquote>To stay honest, on [sic] of major reasons that I didn’t engage in diaspora development, relates to my impression of '''developers community not coordinating with other efforts''' and not engaging in standardization efforts…</blockquote> '''Emphasis''' added.
