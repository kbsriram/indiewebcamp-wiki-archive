'''<dfn>[http://livejournal.com/ LiveJournal]</dfn>''' is a blogging [[silo]].

== Criticisms ==
=== Deletion of inactive accounts ===
If your account is inactive (haven't logged in or posted in a while), LiveJournal may delete it, including all posts & permalinks, with only a 15 day email notice.

Thus it appears LiveJournal is slowly and quietly deleting post permalinks from the web.


On 2014-05-05 [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek Ã‡elik]] received an email apparently from "lj_notify@livejournal.com":

<blockquote><p>
Subject: Purging of your LiveJournal account
</p><p>
We noticed that your account tantek has less than three entries and hasn't
been logged into in over two years. LiveJournal is deleting inactive empty
accounts. Pursuant to our housekeeping policy, your LiveJournal account
tantek is scheduled to be deleted in 15 days.
</p><p>
If you wish to reactivate your account to avoid this deletion, please visit
http://www.livejournal.com and log in within 15 days of this notification.

If you do not remember the password for your account, you can reset it:
