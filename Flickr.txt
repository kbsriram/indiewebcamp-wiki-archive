'''<dfn>[http://flickr.com Flickr]</dfn>''' is a [[silo]] for storing and organizing [[photos]] and short (max 90sec) & small (max 150MB) [[videos]].

== Feeds ==
Flickr has numerous [[feeds]] to views of content that can be used to [[PESOS]] content from Flickr, or to backup recent content.

=== tag feeds ===
Flickr has publicly readable feeds of tagged photos: (e.g. photos tagged with "indiewebcamp")
* http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=indiewebcamp&lang=en-us&format=atom

=== user feeds ===
Flickr's feeds related to a specific user by opaque userid in the URL are also public, e.g. for userid 39039882@N00 (user: http://flickr.com/tantek ) :

photo/video posts from a user: 
* http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=39039882@N00&lang=en-us&format=atom
favorites of a user: 
* http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_faves.gne?nsid=39039882@N00&lang=en-us&format=atom
photos of a user: (people tagged)
* http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/profile_photos.gne?nsid=39039882@N00&lang=en-us&format=atom

== Issues ==
=== Downtime ===

=== Two Pages About You ===
Users on Flickr have two pages "about" them:
* /photos/username (also often works at just /username) - no link to your website, but shows your stream of recent photo [[posts]], and has a [[rel-me]] link to your /people/username page:
* /people/username - has [[rel-me]] support for linking back to your website. Shows a few recent photo thumbnails, recent photos of your, your recent favorites.

No other service splits your profile identity like this. Typical [[silos]] all have integrated profile pages that show <em>both</em> your latest posts and your profile information like your website.

Because of this, and because Flickr encourages linking to the /photos/username page, getting rel=me to work with Flickr is a bit more out-of-the-way work, but still doable.
