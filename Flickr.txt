'''<dfn>[http://flickr.com Flickr]</dfn>''' is a [[silo]] for storing and organizing [[photos]] and short (max 90sec) & small (max 150MB) [[videos]].

== Feeds ==
Flickr has numerous [[feeds]] to views of content that can be used to [[PESOS]] content from Flickr, or to backup recent content.

=== tag feeds ===
Flickr has publicly readable feeds of tagged photos: (e.g. photos tagged with "indiewebcamp")
* http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?tags=indiewebcamp&lang=en-us&format=atom

=== user feeds ===
Flickr's feeds related to a specific user by opaque userid in the URL are also public, e.g. for userid 39039882@N00 (user: http://flickr.com/tantek ) :

photo/video posts from a user: 
* http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_public.gne?id=39039882@N00&lang=en-us&format=atom
favorites of a user: 
* http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/photos_faves.gne?nsid=39039882@N00&lang=en-us&format=atom
photos of a user: (people tagged)
* http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/profile_photos.gne?nsid=39039882@N00&lang=en-us&format=atom

=== activity feed ===

Flickr has a (totally undocumented?) feed of activity for the logged in user, where activity is anything you would normally be notified about in notifications (faves, comments, replies to photos you have replied on). To limit content to only photos in your own stream, add &activity_view=photostream

* https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/activity/all?user_id=me
* https://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/activity/all?user_id=me&activity_view=photostream

These require you to be logged in and redirect to a "secret" URL and may include activity on non-public photos.

== POSSE to Flickr ==
The following have gotten POSSE to Flickr working:
* [[Known]] (e.g. see http://werd.io/ )
* {{adactio}}
* [[WordPress]] with [http://www.nextscripts.com/social-networks-auto-poster-for-wordpress/ SNAP] plugin ( working example: [[User:petermolnar.eu|Peter Molnar]] )

== Privacy ==

=== Location data has different privacy settings from the photos ===
Photos on Flickr have a privacy setting for seeing the photo itself, and a separate privacy setting for viewing the location of the photo. For example it is possible to set a photo to public, but have the location only visible to "Friends and Family".

=== Geofencing ===
Flickr allows you to configure one or more geofences around locations such as "home" or "work", and any time photos are uploaded that fall into that area, the geo privacy will be set automatically.[http://blog.flickr.net/2011/08/30/introducing-geofences-on-flickr/]

== Issues ==
=== PESOS unreliability ===
There has been some experience with a [[PESOS]] approach not working well with Flickr:
* [https://twitter.com/anomalily/status/518830141502685185 2014-10-05 @anomalily] <blockquote>Whoa, leveling up in the #indieweb world: about to switch from PESOS to POSSE for @flickr because PESOS is failing me</blockquote>

Recommendation: [[POSSE]] to Flickr instead of PESOS.

=== Downtime ===
* 2007-02-19 Flickr massage: [http://www.flickr.com/photos/tantek/420426227/ http://farm1.staticflickr.com/186/420426227_dda4d24789_o.png]
=== Two Pages About You ===
Users on Flickr have two pages "about" them:
* /photos/username (also often works at just /username) - no link to your website, but shows your stream of recent photo [[posts]], and has a [[rel-me]] link to your /people/username page:
* /people/username - has [[rel-me]] support for linking back to your website. Shows a few recent photo thumbnails, recent photos of your, your recent favorites.

No other service splits your profile identity like this. Typical [[silos]] all have integrated profile pages that show <em>both</em> your latest posts and your profile information like your website.

Because of this, and because Flickr encourages linking to the /photos/username page, getting rel=me to work with Flickr is a bit more out-of-the-way work, but still doable.
