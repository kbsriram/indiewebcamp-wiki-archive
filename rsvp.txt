An '''<dfn>RSVP</dfn>''' is a type of [[post]] that is a [[reply]] to an [[event]] post.

== How to ==
How tos for RSVPs are very similar to the how tos for [[replies]] so we won't duplicate common info here.
=== Publish an RSVP ===
Post a [[reply]] and follow the [http://microformats.org/wiki/rsvp-brainstorming#h-entry_plus_additions microformats2 h-entry plus proposal] to also post the RSVP status using the proposed <code>p-rsvp</code> property:
* <code>&lt;span class="p-rsvp">no&lt;/span></code> - however this assumes that you want "no" in your readable text. Otherwise you can also use the <code>data</code> element to express the meaning behind the literal p-rsvp value while providing your own visible human readable language:
* <code>&lt;data class="p-rsvp" value="yes">I'm totally there, dude.&lt;/data></code>

Send a webmention to the event post as you would for a reply to any post.

See [[reply#Make_a_comment]] for more general details on posting replies.

(a complete h-entry + p-rsvp markup example would be nice too)

=== Update an RSVP ===
Similarly, update your RSVP and send another webmention.

See [[reply#Update_a_comment]] for more general details on updating replies.

=== Delete an RSVP ===
Similarly, delete your RSVP, send another webmention, and be prepared to return 410 GONE for your RSVP permalink.

See [[reply#Delete_a_comment]] for more general details on deleting replies.

== Why ==
Why implement RSVP posts?

Simple, so you can RSVP from your own site to the [[event]] posts that indieweb community members (like [[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] and [[User:Werd.io|Ben Werdmuller]]) post on their own sites.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
In datetime order of <span id="IndieWeb_Implementations">implementation</span> (earliest first)

=== Ben Werdmuller ===
Ben Werdmuller has implemented RSVP posts in [[idno]].

RSVP posts are marked up with the <code>p-rsvp</code> property from the [http://microformats.org/wiki/rsvp-brainstorming#h-entry_plus_additions microformats2 h-entry plus proposal].

Example:
* http://werd.io/view/51ca1213bed7de1e7763d71f

=== Bret Comnes ===
Bret Comnes has implemented RSVP posts on his site bret.io:

RSVP posts are marked up with the <code>p-rsvp</code> property from the [http://microformats.org/wiki/rsvp-brainstorming#h-entry_plus_additions microformats2 h-entry plus proposal].

Example:
* http://bret.io/2013/06/25/t2/
** on event: http://werd.io/event/51c94deebed7de5c2386a1b4/unofficial-portland-post-indiewebcamp-meetup
** showed up via Bret doing a manual webmention (automation plan: simple shell script that does git push then send webmention)
** It should be noted that any webmention I do will be manual for the time being.  A likely scenario will be some kind of [[webmention.io]] integration when it supports the sending of web-mentions or pingbacks.  It might be possible with fancy JS as well, I am not sure.--[[User:Bret.io|Bret.io]] 18:23, 25 June 2013 (PDT)

=== Aaron Parecki ===
Aaron Parecki has implemented RSVP posts in [[p3k]] deployed on his site aaronparecki.com:

RSVP posts are marked up with the <code>p-rsvp</code> property from the [http://microformats.org/wiki/rsvp-brainstorming#h-entry_plus_additions microformats2 h-entry plus proposal].

Example:
* http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2013/06/25/3/indiewebcamp
** on event http://werd.io/event/51c94deebed7de5c2386a1b4/unofficial-portland-post-indiewebcamp-meetup

==== autosuggest ====
If a [[p3k]] user is creating a [[reply]] to a URL, [[p3k]]:
* parses the reply URL
* looks for an [[h-event]] 
* if it finds one, 
** changes the type from [[reply]] to an [[rsvp]]
** prompts the user to select yes/no/maybe/other

=== Nick Doty ===
[[User:npdoty.name|Nick Doty]] implemented RSVP notes on his site npdoty.com:

Example:
* http://bcc.npdoty.name/post-facto-regrets-and-RSVP-microformat

=== Tantek ===
[[User:Tantek.com|Tantek Ã‡elik]] has implemented RSVP reply notes in [[Falcon]] deployed on his site tantek.com as of 2013-264.

RSVP posts' reply-contexts are marked up with the <code>p-rsvp</code> property from the [http://microformats.org/wiki/rsvp-brainstorming#h-entry_plus_additions microformats2 h-entry plus proposal].

Example:
* http://tantek.com/2013/264/t1/indiewebcamp-breakfast-rsvp
** on event: http://aaronparecki.com/events/2013/09/21/1/indiewebcamp-breakfast
** showed up via Tantek doing a manual webmention (automation plan: have the Falcon posting UI perform webmentions when the user presses the "Post" button)
** It should be noted that any webmention I do will be manual for the time being.
