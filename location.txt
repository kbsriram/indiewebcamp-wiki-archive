'''<dfn>location</dfn>''' is a key aspect of [[checkin]] and [[event]] [[posts]]. It's also sometimes an aspect of posts in general, e.g. where a [[note]] or [[photo]]/[[video]] was posted from. The aspect of location is sometimes referred to as [[geo]] for short.

== How ==
=== How to determine the location of a microformat ===
To accommodate various different location use-cases, there are multiple places within a microformat structure where location data can be placed. Given a microformat, to determine it’s location:

* create a stack of property maps where location data might be found, in order of priority
* for each potential location property, search the stack for a valid property value

In more detail (pseudocode):
* given a microformat structure <var>mf</var>, to find the location it represents:
* let <var>location-sources</var> be a list of microformats, containing the following, in this order:
** <var>mf</var>
** if <var>mf</var> has a ''location'' property which is a microformat, that value
** if <var>mf</var> has an ''adr'' property which is a microformat, that value
** if <var>mf</var> has a ''geo'' property:
*** if the geo property is a microformat, that value
*** else if the geo property is a string, parse it as a geo: URL and append a derived microformat containing the properties of the geo: URL: latitude+longitude if they’re both present, and altitude if it was present
* for each of the following location properties, search the property map stack in order of priority for a valid value. As soon as one is found, consider that the value. If none are found, the microformat does not have this property
** street-address
** extended-address
** post-office-box
** locality
** region
** postal-code
** country-name
** label
** latitude
** longitude
** altitude
