'''<dfn>[http://disqus.com/ Disqus]</dfn>''' is a [[comments]] hosting [[silo]].

You can use Disqus to create a comments embed on your site and blog [[posts]].

Though this does encourage your readers to sharecrop (on Disqus) their comments on your posts, it also provides them a single place to view the comments they've made across any/all sites that use Disqus for comments.

== IndieWeb Experience ==
No indieweb community members are currently using this on their own site(s).

IndieWeb community members that have tried this and their experience:
* Aaron Parecki: "Facebook tends to get more comments [than Disqus] for me probably because everyone has an account and is always logged in"[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-05-17#t1368819651]
* Cweiske: "disqus doesn't work on my page"[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-05-17#t1368819652]

== Issues ==
=== XML invalid ===
From cweiske on IRC: [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-05-17#t1368819652]
<blockquote>
I'm using application/xhtml+xml as content type for my html pages, and disqus breaks because of this<br/>
contacted their support several times and they don't plan to support that
</blockquote>

== Criticism ==
=== Displays ads on site to public but not owner ===
Via https://twitter.com/fdevillamil/status/394368809597149184, in short:
<blockquote>I'm getting reports that disqus shows ads to everyone but the admins/site-owner and uses some very shady tactics to do it.</blockquote>[https://twitter.com/zedshaw/status/394334044487307264]

'''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie#Supercookie_.28other_uses.29 Supercookie]''' used to do so:
<blockquote>Confirmed, looks like Disqus is using a super cookie to track me even after clearing cookies and then avoids showing the ads to me.</blockquote>[https://twitter.com/zedshaw/status/394335690151849984]
