A '''<dfn>people tag</dfn>''' is a special kind of [[tag]] that refers to a specific person by URL rather than just a word or phrase.

== Why ==
By supporting people tags in [[posts]], you can more explicitly/automatically notify people via [[webmention]] to their [[homepage]] at their URL that you have explicitly tagged a post as being about them, e.g. a [[photo]] post where they're in the photo.

== How ==
No specific proposals yet by any IndieWeb implementations.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
None so far.

== Silo Examples ==
The following [[silos]] support people tagging and are thus a good starting point for documenting people-tagging user experiences for recreation on indieweb sites.
* [[Facebook]] - all post types, an explicit text mention is interpreted as a people tag, plus you can explicitly people tag areas of photo posts
* [[Flickr]] - you can people tag a photo and optionally denote a rectangle of the photo that indicates that person
* [[Instagram]] - you can people tag a photo and optionally denote a point on the photo (from which the label of the person's name is hung).
* [[Twitter]] - photos in tweets can be people-tagged - [https://blog.twitter.com/2014/photos-just-got-more-social see details].
* [[Google+]] - photos can be people-tagged - [https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1304814 see details].

== Brainstorming ==
=== HTML imagemaps ===
[[User:benwerd.com|Ben Werdmuller]] wondered if you could tag people in photos by linking to their profiles using HTML imagemaps (!) and marking up the imagemap links with microformats. That might look something like:

<code><img src="some_photo.jpg" alt="Tantek, Aaron and Amber!" usemap="#peeps" class="u-photo">

<map name="peeps">

<area shape="circle" coords="124,58,8" class="microcard h-card u-url" href="http://tantek.com" alt="Tantek Ã‡elik">

<area shape="rect" coords="0,0,82,126" class="microcard h-card u-url"  href="http://aaronparecki.com" alt="Aaron Parecki">

<area shape="circle" coords="90,58,3" class="microcard h-card u-url" href="http://caseorganic.com" alt="Amber Case">

</map></code>

However, because the HTML syntax of imagemaps sits outside the actual image tag, it may be worth adding a microformat to the map itself.

== SWAT0 ==
People tagging was one of the steps of the [[SWAT0]] social web acid test developed / proposed in 2010.
