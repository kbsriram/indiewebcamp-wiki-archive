Your homepage represents you on the web. Typically it’s at the root of your domain (e.g. example.com).

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Some interesting indieweb home page examples of contact information (e.g. [[hCard]]), maps for location, live IM status etc. - probably worth expanding and document each of these:

* http://scottbullard.com/ - phone/email links with more: http://scottbullard.com/more.html
* http://www.jaredhanson.net/ - live IM status on Jared's hCard
* http://npdoty.name/ - map as background centered on his current location

== Things currently on homepages ==
* A '''profile''', marked up with [[h-card]].
** Photo, name, URL, approximate location, short bio, categories/tags
** [[rel-me]] links to your other identities on the web
* contact links (aim: mailto: tel: etc. see [http://tantek.com/2013/338/b1/people-focused-mobile-communication-experience] for some UI brainstorming on this)
* A composite [[feed]] of all your [[post]]s
* Your local time
* Last seen (last checkin/location post)
* upcoming events
* projects
* [[disclosure]] - disclosures of various types, e.g. cookies or analytics tracking

== Homepage Brainstorming ==
Things which could go on homepages which aren’t currently implemented, or are underimplemented. Sometimes there is an intent to implement.

* [[payment]] links/buttons
* local weather/daylight (extra context)
* people I’ve mentioned recently
* tags I’ve used recently
* actions like subscribe, contact, add to address book
* latest comments

I might be adding links to /me (my profile page) and /about (about the site, license info, powered by, hosted at, etc.) to my homepage. --[[User:Sandeep.io|Sandeep Shetty]]

=== Sketches ===
I did some homepage sketches/brainstorming [https://github.com/Taproot/design/blob/master/homepage-brainstorming.jpg here] --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 14:32, 18 June 2013 (PDT)

=== Webmention to homepage ===
[[Webmention]]s sent directly to home pages could serve a number of use-cases:
* notification of a person-mention (like an indieweb @-mention) on a post somewhere else
* [[invitation]] to an indie [[event]]
* notification of a new private [[message]] received

== Articles ==
Articles and posts about homepage design and features:
