{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[http://ogp.me/ The Open Graph protocol]</dfn>''' (OGP) is an open* standard developed by [[Facebook]] for annotating the primary subject of an HTML page via a set of custom <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tags in the document head.

<nowiki>*</nowiki>OGP is licensed using the [http://openwebfoundation.org/legal/the-0-9-agreements---necessary-claims Open Web Foundation Agreement, Version 0.9]. Though not as good as [[CC0]]+[[OWFa]] 1.0, it's still a considerably open license for a web standard.
__TOC__

== Criticism ==
=== Pseudo-RDFa ===
Rather than use existing meta tag "name" attribute, OGP uses the RDFa "property" attribute, as well as prefixes property names with "og:" to give the appearance of RDFa:

Instead of:
<pre><nowiki>
<meta name="description" content="invisible description of the page"/> 
</nowiki></pre>

OGP uses:
<pre><nowiki>
<meta property="og:description" content="invisible description of the page"/>
</nowiki></pre>

(actual meta name from web legacy and OGP property from their spec)

Text from the facebook validator if you use <code>meta name="description"</code>:
<blockquote>Extraneous Property: Objects of this type do not allow properties named 'description'.<p>
Mismatched Metadata: The parser's result for this metadata did not match the input metadata. Likely, this was caused by the data being ordered in an unexpected way, multiple values being given for a property only expecting a single value, or property values for a given property being mismatched. Here are the input properties that were not seen in the parsed result: 'og:description'</blockquote>

=== Depends on Invisible Metadata ===
Meta tags, no matter how well intentioned, are another form of invisible meta data, which are subject to all the same problems they've always been since meta keywords ([[DRY]] violation, rotting, spamming, etc.).

The RDFapologism of using a "property" attribute instead of a "name" attribute doesn't change this, nor does the "og:" syntactic vinegar prefix.

=== Disallows relative URLs ===
Apparently OGP doesn't allow relative URLs[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-08-19/line/1408480229851].
if you put relative paths into og meta tags eg

<nowiki><meta property="og:image" content="images/logo.png" /></nowiki>

it fails in the [https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/og/object/ Facebook validator]

=== Does not support SVG images ===
if you include 

<nowiki><meta property="og:image" content="http://mysite.com/logo.svg" /></nowiki>

The Facebook validator will say it is not an image.

== Alternative ==
Use [[microformats]] to markup the <em>visible</em> information on the page instead.
