''The '<dfn>[https://github.com/dshanske/indieweb-taxonomy Indieweb Taxonomy] Plugin</dfn>''' is a [[WordPress]] plugin that adds response support to WordPress.

It creates a taxonomy called Kind, which consists of types Reply, Repost, RSVP, Like, Favorite, and Bookmark. It then adds post metadata boxes to the WordPress post editor for a URL, a title, and content/citation. This allows a post to act as a response to another post, quote, etc. 

The post uses the Webmention Plugin to send webmentions to any URL it is responding to.
