I like Reeder because of its fast, buttery interface.  It starts quickly and lets me read cached stories quicker than most readers I have ever tried.  I use it to read the last few days of news from a few hundred websites offline while on the bus because a small mobile data plan.  It has a thoughtful clean UI.  Definitely worth checking out.  --[[User:Bret.io|Bret.io]] 17:33, 28 March 2014 (PDT)
