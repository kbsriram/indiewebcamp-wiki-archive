A '''<dfn>collection</dfn>''' is a type of [[post]] that explicitly lists and/or embeds multiple other posts chosen by the author. 

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Kyle Mahan ===
{{kylewm}} uses [[Red Wind]] to publish collection posts on kylewm.com [http://kylewm.com/share/2014/04/14/1 since 2014-04-14]. Example:
* http://kylewm.com/share/2014/04/14/1
=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} uses [[p3k]] to publish collection posts on aaronparecki.com [http://aaronparecki.com/collections/2014/08/14/1/ since 2014-08-14]. Example:
* http://aaronparecki.com/collections/2014/08/14/1/

== Silo Examples ==
=== Storify ===
[[Storify]] is a silo for collecting tweets ([[Twitter]] [[notes]]). Examples:
* https://storify.com/charlesarthur/oh-hai-sexism
* https://storify.com/jcolman/mike-monteiro-design-facebook

== Changes ==
Collections can change over time but typically don't change much. Changes to collections typically consist of additions, rarely is something removed from a collection. 
== Different from a feed ==
[[feeds]] on the other hand are typically automatic sets of posts where the set changes often, new posts showing up, and old posts dropping off.

* [[album]]
