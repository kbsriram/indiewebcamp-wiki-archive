An '''<dfn>article</dfn>''' is a kind of [[post]] that typically has more structure than a simple [[note]]. Articles usually have a name (title), multiple paragraphs, and often subheadings, blockquotes, and a footer of references or citations.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
There are plenty of examples of IndieWeb sites posting articles, as articles essentially represent what used to simply be called "blog posts".

== Brainstorming ==
=== ID markup for paragraphs etc ===
Marking up paragraphs with unique id attributes may enable more granular referencing for quotations within them, and possibly more granular [[comments]] as well.
