'''<dfn>[http://atomenabled.org/ Atom]</dfn>''' is an XML format for publishing [[feeds]] that was developed as a more formally specified alternative to [[RSS]].

'''[[h-entry]]''' and '''[[h-feed]]''' are [[microformats2]] vocabularies based on Atom, which supersede the classic [[hAtom]] microformat.

== IndieWeb implementations ==
* '''sandeep.io''' generates an Atom feed from [http://microformats.org/wiki/h-feed h-feed] (using an h-feed to atom proxy). See [http://www.sandeep.io/98 DRY: h-feed enabled = Atom enabled] -[[User:Www.sandeep.io|Www.sandeep.io]] 14:06, 30 June 2013 (PDT)
* '''tantek.com''' generates (using [[Falcon]]) an Atom+ActivityStreams feed from storage
* '''[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk]]''' generates ATOM feeds from canonical HTML+h-feed feed pages on waterpigs.co.uk using [[Taproot]]

=== RSS Atom wars ===
From 2003-2007 (at least) there was significant energy put into debating the merits of using [[Atom]] vs [[RSS]]. This quite heated ongoing debate earned the name of "<dfn>RSS Atom Wars</dfn>" or "<dfn>syndication wars</dfn>". A few articles during this time period help illustrate the tensions and conflicts:

* 2004-03-10 Seth Finkelstein: [http://sethf.com/infothought/blog/archives/000558.html RSS/Atom Wars - Peace In Our Time?]: <blockquote><p>How can you route around big media, revolutionize society, create new forms of participatory democracy, solve deeply complicated social problems ... when "we" '''CAN'T EVEN AGREE ON A FORMAT FOR WEB SITE CONTENT SYNDICATION?!'''</p><p>Really. Site syndication is a "little" problem. Nobody is going to literally die over it. Not like access to health care, or poverty, or world wars.</p></blockquote>['''ALL CAPS EMPHASIS''' is from original]
