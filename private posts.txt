{{stub}}

'''<dfn>private posts</dfn>''' refer to [[posts]] or portions of posts which are [[privacy|private]] to either the author or to a limited audience chosen by the author. Typical [[silos]] offer some form of private posts (or messaging, like email).This is a nascent area on the indieweb.

== Use Cases ==
There are numerous use case for private posts, however here we are capturing use-cases raised by active Indieweb community members that wish to [[selfdogfood]] such features on their own site.

=== Private messaging ===
From Aaron Parecki (who has implemented this on his site)
* [[indieweb-messaging]]

=== Allow silo friends to see private posts ===
From Tom Morris in IRC:
<blockquote>Allowing your [[Facebook]] friends to see things where you assume they *don't* have their own domain", and thus you'd need to support some form of Facebook-authentication to verify their identities before showing them the private post(s) you'd like them to see. "Similarly [[Twitter]]" friends.</blockquote>

Need to maintain an address book to coordinate identities across various silos, and allow users alternative authentication mechanisms (I'd be inclined to include email). Posts could be shared with individual address-book entries or predefined mailing-lists. Or dynamic lists like "Facebook friends", "Twitter friends" above, or as [[User:aaronparecki.com|Aaron]] [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-04/line/1399224045 suggested], all the h-cards linked to from a webpage like [[irc-people]]   --[[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]] 11:56, 8 May 2014 (PDT)

Tantek on [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-08/line/1399575433 IRC 2014-05-08]:
<blockquote>
interesting - I think tommorris was putting a bunch
of thought into private posts - as he wants to do exactly that (with
giving permissions to FB friends). re: address book - the minimal viable address book should
be just a list of URLs of people in storage. On top of that, cache their
full name and photo from their h-card at their URL (or retrieved by
snowflake API from their silo profile URL). everything else should be retrieved dynamically from their
personal site / profile URL. apply caching as needed. once you make your addressbook person-URL-centric, then all the permissions stuff becomes super obvious
</blockquote>

=== Partial Page Privacy ===

During IndieWebCamp Online 2014, the question was raised of how to indicate that some or all of a page was not for public consumption.

The Use Case for this came during {{benthatmustbeme}}'s review of his contact page, which displays additional contacts to logged in users. The question was raised of how you would tell a logged in user that you did not want them to share contacts which were not public, as many sites, systems would automatically log in.

The proposed solution was suggested in marking up the information appropriately. Possible parameters might include
* For Eyes Only - Indicating that the information should not be distributed
* For Specified Group - Indicating some group it may be shared with
* The Absence of such markup would suggest public information

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* [[Red Wind]] has rudimentary support for private posts based on a simple list of the domains of people authorized to view a private post. The posts are viewable only if the [[IndieAuth]]ed user is in the audience list.<br>Example note from {{kylewm}}'s site:<br>[[File:kmahan-private-note-display.png|border|500px]]<p>[[Posting interface]]:<br>[[File:kmahan-private-note-edit.png|border|500px]]

== Silo Examples ==
We can learn from the UI that [[silos]] use to present and edit the privacy of posts.

=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] posts have varying degrees of (apparent) "privacy". [[photo]]s are a particularly interesting example, where it appears their viewability is on a spectrum. E.g. common examples: 
* public (indexable)
* public (no robots / login required)
* friends of anyone [[person-tag]]ged in the photo
* friends of the author of the photo
* subset of friends (curated whitelist) of the author of the photo
* only the author

=== Google Plus ===
TODO: find a screenshot of Google+ posts shared publicly as well as with a circle.
