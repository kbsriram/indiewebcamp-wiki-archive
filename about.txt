About

About is a common page or section on sites that acts as an overview of the site. On a personal site, this would be usually be in the form of an expanded [[h-card]]. This can either be on a dedicated page, on every page, or often on the front page. 

The key part of the About is the p-note of the h-card, which attempts to introduce the site visitor to the person in a simple and plain manner. 

== Guidelines ==

A good About p-note has to be brief. There is always the opportunity to expand later. This is not a resume. This is to introduce people to the author.
