"'''<dfn>About</dfn>'''" is a commonly occurring page or section on a site that provides an introduction, overview, or summary of the site. On a personal site, this would be usually be in the form of an expanded [[h-card]] about the person. About information can either be on a dedicated page, on every page (e.g. in a [[footer]]), or often on the site [[home page]].

The key part of the About is the p-note of the h-card, which attempts to introduce the site visitor to the person in a simple and plain manner. 

== Guidelines ==
A good About p-note has to be brief. There is always the opportunity to expand later. This is not a resume. This is to introduce people to the author and owner of the site.
