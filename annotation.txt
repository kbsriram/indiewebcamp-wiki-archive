{{stub}}

An '''annotation''' is a comment added to arbitrary fragments of a post, in contrast to a  [[comment|traditional comment]] which refers to the entire post.

== Medium ==

[http://medium.com Medium] supports paragraph-level comments through a Twitter login. (Screenshots of the article [https://medium.com/cool-code-pal/b21bfc1f63c7] as on 2014-04-16) Posting a comment is triggered by clicking on a "+" sign on the top-right corner of a paragraph.

Similarly, you can read the comments by clicking on the number on the top-right corner. On large screens the annotations appear in a sidebar on the right.

For medium-sized screens the main text slides out of the screen to the left, making room for the sidebar.

For small screens the annotations are displayed in an overlay. Swiping to the left scrolls through the annotations.

On mobile Firefox the overlay additionally includes highlighting on the original content, but breaks on swiping to read next comment.

=== Criticism ===

* small target links. The buttons for the annotations are too small; being hard to click/tap or accidental click/tap. See [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-04-17/line/1397720432]

* Complete Javascript dependence: If there is no javascript (or it is broken) the reader sees no annotations at all. A good default would be show all the annotations as normal comments below the article.

* loss of context in the sidebar UI. The main content moves out of the screen and the reader loses context of the main content.
