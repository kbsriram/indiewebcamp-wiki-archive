'''<dfn>tags</dfn>''' or '''<dfn>tagging</dfn>''' may refer to:
* a method of categorizing content by applying free form words and phrases to it, not part of any formal taxonomy (more of a folksonomy), popularized in Web 2.0 by various silos ([[Delicious]] (original site defunct) & [[Flickr]]), blogging tools (e.g. [[WordPress]]), and blog search engines (Technorati (original tag search defunct)).
* '''[[hashtags]]''' - a method of tagging [[posts]] merely by prefixing the literal text of the tag inline in the post content with hash or pound character '#'. Popularized on [[Twitter]], hashtags have been adopted on other silos as such as [[Instagram]], Google+, [[Tumblr]], [http://newsroom.fb.com/News/633/Public-Conversations-on-Facebook Facebook], etc.
* '''Private Tags''' -  a tag that is only visible to the content creator.
** Pinboard.in does this with special syntax: tags that start with a period. e.g., .secret_tag. See https://pinboard.in/tour/#privacy
** Private tags can be used to do [[POSSE]] stuff like what [https://www.facebook.com/selectivetwitter/info Selective Tweets] does with the #fb tag, but without having a visible public tag: like this IFTTT receipe that [https://ifttt.com/recipes/14872 crossposts Pinboard bookmarks to Twitter that have the .twitter private tag].
** I have a #readlater tag that I would love to have private -[[User:Www.sandeep.io|Www.sandeep.io]] 16:37, 11 September 2013 (PDT)
* [[User:Sandeep.io|Sandeep Shetty]] uses a #private tag (as a way to reduce an interface element that is required less often) to make posts only visible to him. 
** You can combine Private tags and #private to make both tags and content visible only to the author.
