'''<dfn>[http://blogger.com/ Blogger]</dfn>''' is a blog content hosting [[silo]] owned by [[Google]]. 

"Blogger" used to be the name of (one of?) the first blogging application services ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service SaaS]) that used your own domain and your own [[hosting]] provider for the storage of your blog, and FTP as an API to edit your site. If the Blogger application went down, your site still worked (to serve your posts) - the only thing you couldn't do was use the application to edit or publish new posts. In this way, the original Blogger was quite an indieweb-enabling tool - you still fully owned and controlled your content, as it was all stored on your own web host.

Google shutdown the Blogger application on 2010-05-01.[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogger_%28service%29]

The Blogger team created "Blogspot.com" as a hosted version ([[silo]]) of the Blogger application, which was later served from blogger.com and then renamed to "Blogger", thus replacing the original meaning and web application functionality with a [[silo]].
