'''<dfn>IPv6</dfn>''' is version 6 of the ''Internet Protocol''.

== Why? ==
There are numerous improvements in IPv6. The most pressing reason to implement IPv6 however is the increased address space. IPv4 uses 32-bit numbers to address devices connected to the internet. This means there are roughly 4.3 billion different addresses. The way these addresses are assigned, broadly speaking, is a central organisation called the IANA (Internet Assingned Numbers Authority) assisgns blocks of addresses to each of the five RIR (Regional Internet Registries) who the in turn assign addresses to their respective ISPs. Whilst none of the RIRs have currently run out of addresses, the IANA have.

We've basically run out of IPv4 addresses. IPv6 however uses 128-bit numbers to address devices connected to the internet. Therefore running out of addresses is much less of a problem.

I would actually argue that the primary advantage of ipv6 in this space isn't the amount of available addresses (that is important). I would argue that the most primary advantage is that there is no such thing as NAT in ipv6. NAT is the bane of the internet and why we aren't already living in a p2p utopia. -- home.tylergillies.club

== How ==
The software side of things should be relatively easy. For example, in nginx its as simple as adding a listen [::]:80 line in the server{} block.

Getting the server itself connectable over IPv6 can be a little more tricky.

If you do not have native ipv6 support from your ISP you can configure a tunnel from [tunnelbroker.net] They have a nice form you fill out and they have a configuration dropdown for your operating system. If you run into any difficulty I'll be more than happy to assist ( tjgillies@nospam-gmail.com) -- home.tylergillies.club
