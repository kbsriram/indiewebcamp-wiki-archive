What should be on your indie web site home page?

== Getting Started ==
If you're just [[getting started]]:
* [[about]] / [[profile]] / contact information with an [[hCard]]
** examples of contact info / about info only: aralbalkan.com, ebdesign.se, old (pre-2012) adactio.com
* [[How_to_set_up_web_sign-in_on_your_own_domain|web-sign-in support]]

== Feeds ==
Next, it's quite popular to have:
* [[feed]] of your most recent posts and other activities.
** mixed/composite feed examples: tantek.com, new (late 2012+) adactio.com
** separate feeds: aaronparecki.com

== Discovery ==
Your home page is the URL you share with people, therefore it's useful to set it up with:
* [[discovery]] of what else you have on your site

== Previously ==
Among early 2000s bloggers it was popular to also have on your home page:
* [[blogroll]]

== Signed-in Features ==
When signed-in to your own site, it might be useful to have:
* [[feed reader]] - feed of posts from others you follow
** silo examples of such a logged in home page: [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]] - logged in dashboard

== related ==
* [[2012/UK/Demos]] - specifically, General discussion / UX thoughts.
* [[feeds]]
* [[about]]
* [[icon]]
