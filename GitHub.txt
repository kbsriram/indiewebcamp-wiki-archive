'''<dfn>[http://github.com GitHub]</dfn>''' is a specialized content hosting [[silo]] for code, issues, comments, and static content that has some aspects of a [[commons]], and through free domain mapping, a [[content hosting service]] as well.

== GitHub Pages ==
__TOC__
GitHub's <dfn>GitHub Pages</dfn> (gh-pages) feature is a [[web_hosting#Static_domain_hosting|static domain hosting]] where you can host your static sites. They offer pre-built web page templates, as well as the ability to build and host [[Jekyll]] websites.

Static content hosting is a form of [[web hosting]] that can be used for [[getting started]] on the IndieWeb.

See [https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages GitHub's instructions for setting up a custom domain] for details.

=== Guides === 
There are several guides on how (and approaches) to use GitHub Pages to host your website:
* [[Jekyll]],  http://jekyllrb.com/, is enabled by default on GitHub Pages, but you can also build locally and push to GitHub.
* http://opentechschool.github.io/social-coding/extras/github-pages.html
* Example: [http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2012/08/11/now-powered-by-jekyll-and-github-pages/ BootStrap blog powered by Jekyll and GitHub pages]

=== Fork'n'Go ===

Some websites provide ready-to-fork repositories that one can use to get started. These *don't* have to be used with GitHub, but they are configured to use GitHub pages by default.

* [http://octopress.org/ Octopress] provides a rich website construction toolkit, based on top of Jekyll.
* [http://pjf.id.au/ pjf.id.au] has his entire website under CC-BY, with a branch on github specifically for forking the design and build process. Like Octopress, it uses Jekyll underneath. See the [https://github.com/pjf/pjf.github.io github repo] for details.
* [[coisas]] is a browser-based CMS that works only with GitHub Pages, it has a [http://github.com/fiatjaf/coisas-template template] that can be forked from the website UI, and then worked on without need of ever touching the command line.

=== Advantages ===
* An advantage to using a GitHub based solution is that you can easily transfer it to another web host simply by deploying from GitHub to your web host.

=== Limitations ===
==== No HTTP Status Code Control ====
gh-pages does not allow you to setup custom HTTP [status] return codes. -bret (in IRC 2013-176, unlogged).

If a page exists, GitHub Pages will return "200 OK"

If a page does not exist, or was deleted, GitHub Pages will return "404 Not Found"

For some as yet unknown reason, GitHub Pages will return a 301 redirect to the same URL on the first request to a page in a "while". On subsequent requests, it will return the actual page content.

There is ongoing discussion on using http-equiv codes to work around limitations like these.
See: [[deleted#Brainstorming]]

====Limited file types====
GitHub isn't a very good host for large media files, especially if they change, although there is nothing stopping you from uploading media.  Only serve files from gh-pages, as raw repository links have to come out of some application layer, and thus are slower to retrieve.  Github enforces a soft repository [https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-my-disk-quota size limit of about 1Gb].

====Jekyll Safe Mode====
If you wish for GitHub to build your [[Jekyll]] website for you on their server, you must conform to the [https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages restrictions associated with jekyll safe mode], which means no plugins.  You can pre-process with as many plugins as you want and upload raw html files instead as a simple workaround (similar to how [[octopress]] works).

====No SSL on your own domains====
While GitHub Pages supports shared SSL for pages under the *.github.io domain, it does not support using your own SSL cert for your own domain.

== POSSE to GitHub ==
For POSSEing source code to github, see [[git]].

=== IndieWeb Examples ===
==== Aaron Parecki ====
[[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] is manually [[POSSE]]ing comments on GitHub issues from his own site to GitHub. E.g.:
* http://aaronparecki.com/replies/2013/08/14/6/mailpile (original)
** https://github.com/pagekite/Mailpile/issues/48#issuecomment-22682787 (POSSE copy on GitHub)

== Porting to the IndieWeb ==
Example github activity [[Atom]] [[feed]] whereby you can export or [[PESOS]] your activities from:
* https://github.com/tantek.atom (for account name "tantek")

== Self-hosted alternatives ==
{{main|git#Software}}
There are various self-hosted alternatives to github:
* [[gitlab]]
* [[gitosis]]
* [[gitorious]]

== Criticism ==
* You can lose your data due to unjustified DMCA takedowns:

** Github has since improved this process by defining how they are handled better, specifically allowing for the owner to make needed corrections or to move hosts. https://github.com/blog/1908-a-better-dmca-process
