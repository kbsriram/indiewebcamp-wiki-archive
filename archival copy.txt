An '''<dfn>archival copy</dfn>''' is a copy of a web page made (often by someone other than the author) at a particular point in time, that can be used as a reference if the original disappears or is temporarily unavailable.

Archival copies are sometimes called "archives" for short, however in the context of independent publishing, the term "[[archive]]" is specifically used to refer to personal historical archives and the navigation to use them on a personal site.[http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_an_Archive_Index][https://movabletype.org/documentation/administrator/publishing/archive-mapping.html][https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/43708?hl=en##archive]
