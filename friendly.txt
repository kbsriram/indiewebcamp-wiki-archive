= How to make your site Indieweb Friendly =
If you're making a content hosting service (e.g. for blogging, photo posting, etc.) and want to be indieweb friendly and interoperate with indieweb sites, start with doing the following:

Indieweb basics:
# Provide a way for users to enter a personal website/blog, and then automatically link to it from their profile page with [[rel-me|rel=me]].
# Markup users' feeds with the [[h-entry]] microformat including a nested [[h-card]] for the authorship information.
# Markup users' profile pages with [[h-card]]
# Let the user automatically syndicate in [[posts]] from their personal site
# Support [[PuSH]] notifications for receiving posts from their personal site
# Support parsing [[h-entry]] from their personal site posts to syndicate into your service
# Link permalinks back to users' original posts from syndicated copies on your service
# Use [[rel-canonical]] on links from syndicated copies on your service to original posts.
# Support [[webmention]] + [[h-entry]] parsing for receiving [[comments]] on users' posts.

Data portability:
# Provide a way for users to export all their user data (posts, comments, tags, likes/faves).
# Provide HTTP redirects if users want to change their domain name.
## (If a service provides profiles such as name.example.com, and the person wants to change to name.com, the service should leave HTTP redirects in place for name.example.com/* -> name.com/*)
# ...

== Organisations who are Indieweb Friendly ==

* [http://spreadly.com/ spreadly] sends [[in-reply-to]] and [[like]] [[webmentions]] with [[authorship]] markup when people share a link ([http://my.spread.ly/share/51d570bc09e9486562000002 example])
* [[App.net]] supports various indieweb building blocks, outlined in Dalton’s [http://blog.app.net/2013/08/07/response-to-brennan-novak-part-ii/ response to Brennan Novak part 2], including:
** [[PuSH]] support both as a publisher and (!) a subscriber, i.e. you can [[POSSE]] to App.net without writing a single line of code if you already publish an ATOM feed
** [[rel-me]] support for verified domains, enabling use as an [[indieauth]] provider
** [[microformats2]] support on feeds and post permalinks including [[h-card]] and [[h-entry]]
** displays a link to the canonical version of your own posts ([http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2854/9698340641_718f6d231d_o.png example])
