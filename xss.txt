==XSS from webmentions==

If you have implemented [[webmention]]s on your site, you should be aware of XSS attacks. OWASP has a [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/XSS_%28Cross_Site_Scripting%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet good summary]  of preventative measures.

I've put up a [https://checkmention.appspot.com little appengine service] that can send dubious webmentions to your site so you can test how the code handles them. The source is [https://github.com/kbsriram/checkmention on github] - please do add additional tests and patches.


==test cases for handling webmention-related code==

If you prefer, this can be hosted somewhere, and used as the "source" for a webmention. Update the in-reply-to tag as appropriate, and ensure that any markup that you extract into your site remains "safe".
