= Comments Presentation =
Expansion of a section of the page on [[comment]] [[posts]] on how to display received comments.

How comments are presented, should be, and who is doing what.

== How to ==
=== How to display ===
Goal: display received comments in high fidelity, at least as nicely designed as the comments that are "natively" displayed on blog posts and [[silo]] posts (e.g. replies on [[Twitter]] posts, comments on [[Facebook]] posts, [[Flickr]]/[[Instagram]] photos, etc. - see [[#Silos|Silos]] below for analysis of their practices).

Per [[comment#Accept_a_comment|Accept a comment]], your system should already be:
* Listening for [[webmention]] on your server (have your server software support it)

And when your server receives a webmention URL:
* parse the '''[[h-entry]]''' at that URL (only use the first h-entry if there's more than one, seriously, it's supposed to be a permalink) - use a [[microformats2]] parser to do so.
* if its hyperlink to the original post lacks [[in-reply-to]] markup, then add it to the "Related Articles" or "Mentions" section in the [[posts#Footer_sections|post footer]], otherwise keep going:
* '''get commenter information to display'''
** if the h-entry has a '''p-author''', use its '''h-card''':
** otherwise get the first[[#first-rel-author|*]] '''rel-author''' link on the page, retrieve the URL it points to, and use its representative '''h-card''':
*** '''logo/photo'''
*** '''name'''
*** '''url''' (of commenter profile/homepage)
* '''get the text of the comment to display'''
** if the h-entry has an '''e-content''', and if the text is not too long (per your own site UI preference/design, but note that "too long" may be both by character/word count or by number of lines if the content contains newlines), use that, after [[sanitize|sanitizing]] (filtering out unsafe HTML).
** if there is no '''e-content''' or it's too long, then
*** if the h-entry has a '''p-summary''', and the text is not too long, use that (useful author crafted summary or for longer posts where only a part of it is the comment)
**** if the '''p-summary''' is too long (per your own site UI preference/design), then truncate the '''p-summary''' yourself
*** else truncate the '''e-content''' (if any) yourself.
** otherwise (no '''e-content''' and no '''p-summary'''), if it has a '''p-name''', use that
*** if the '''p-name''' is too long (per your own site UI preference/design)
*** then truncate the '''p-name''' yourself.
** if the text of the comment is too long (your site, your judgment), abbreviate it with some intelligent ellipsing code (e.g. see [[Twitter#POSSE_abbr_note_to_twitter|POSSEing an abbreviated note to Twitter]] for some thinking) and provide a "See more" link to the permalink.
* '''get more comment info to display'''
** use the h-entry '''dt-published''' for the time of the reply
*** additionally, its '''dt-updated''' could be used for an "edited: datetime" annotation in your display
** use its '''u-url''' for the permalink (hyperlink the time of reply to the permalink)
* '''optional location brainstorm''' - because not many have implemented location info in posted replies
** use the h-entry '''p-geo''' / p-latitude / p-longitude for location - you may need to use a service to translate that into a human readable neighborhood / city / state / country name. perhaps hyperlink to a map, or an aggregation on your site of all posts (and comments) near that location.
*** (Issue: perhaps [[h-entry]] could use a [[p-location]] property similar to [[h-event]] that would permit embedding of an [[h-adr]] with structured address information.)

With that information a sufficiently rich display should be possible in a "Comments" section in the footer on the original post permalink. Add to that for each comment:
* [[webaction]] like/favorite/props button/link
And you've hopefully got a comment display of similar fidelity to anything the [[silos]] have.

Note: some of this has been implemented!
* [[Storytlr]] receives comment posts via [[pingback]], then parses the post content and author information from the [[h-entry]] and [[h-card]] on the page, and then displays:
** author of comment from h-card / name, photo, url properties
** contents of comment post from h-entry / content, published, url properties
** e.g.: http://eschnou.com/entry/testing-indieweb-federation-with-waterpigscouk-aaronpareckicom-and--62-24908.html
* ... what implementation will be next?

Issues:
* '''<span id="first-rel-author">"*first" rel-author</span>''' is good enough because a) there aren't many multiauthor blogs, comparatively speaking, and more importantly b) this is retrieving a *reply* post, and those are always written by a single person, so there should only be a single rel-author on *that* page. Real-world counter-examples welcome.

==== in realtime ====
Even better, if you can display comments in '''real-time''' on people viewing a post, when they're received by your server, it looks amazing to the user. Idea/challenge [[events/2013-09-30-indieweb-dinner#Realtime_inline_display_of_comments|2013-09-30]].

How to overview:
* keep a websocket open from the browser view of your post with comments to your server
* have your server push comments to your browser view your post through the open websocket.

===== IndieWeb Implementations =====
====== Aaron Parecki ======
[[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] has supported real-time display of received comments on his posts on [http://Aaronparecki.com aaronparecki.com] using [[p3k]] since [http://aaronparecki.com/articles/2013/10/13/1/realtime-indieweb-comments 2013-10-13].

=== How to markup ===

The post the comments are in reply to should be a top-level h-entry, and comments on it should be marked up as h-cites nested under the comment property. For example:

<pre><nowiki>
<div class="h-entry">
 <h1 class="p-name">The Main Entry</div>
 <p class="p-author h-card">John Smith</p>
 <p class="e-content">Blah blah blah blah</p>
 
 <h2>Comments</h2>
 
 <div class="p-comment h-cite">
  <p class="p-author h-card">Jane Bloggs</p>
  <p class="p-summary">Ha ha ha great article John</p>
 </div>
 • 
 •
 •
</div>
</nowiki></pre>

See: http://microformats.org/wiki/comment-brainstorming#microformats2_p-comment_h-entry

==== p-summary on comment body ====
The class p-summary is used on the p-comment h-cite because the expectation is that the site may have summarized (or truncated) the actual content from the original reply post, using the summary/truncating algorithms above.

==== empty in-reply-to inside comments ====
In addition, since the displayed comments are on the page with the URL that they are "in-reply-to", you can add an empty u-in-reply-to property which will automatically become the permalink when parsed due to URL absolute canonicalization rules. E.g. this inside each displayed comment:

<code><nowiki><a href="" class="u-in-reply-to"></a></nowiki></code>

or

<code><nowiki><span class="u-in-reply-to"></span></nowiki></code>

Why would you want to do this? See: http://microformats.org/wiki/comment-brainstorming#Use_case_for_same_page_u-in-reply-to

==== Issues ====

* I think the h-cite markup only works for comments via pingback/webmention, but what about comments made directly on the post using a comment-form? -- [[User:Notizblog.org|pfefferle]]

=== How to delete ===
{{main|deleted#Handling}}
How to delete comments received from other sites.

If an indie web [[reply]]/comment post is [[deleted]], that user's site is expected to send another webmention accordingly.

If when attempting to retrieve the reply permalink URL your server receives a 410 GONE, then your server is expected to delete the existing syndicated copy of that comment.

See [[deleted#Handling|handling deleted posts]] for details.

== Current Indiewebcamp Practices ==
Automatically:
* '''[[User:Eschnou.com|Laurent Eschenauer]] using [[Storytlr]]''': displays comment posts from the IndieWeb marked up with [[h-entry]] and received via [[pingback]], and comments posted locally on his posts, in an integrated time-ordered "Comments" section, e.g.:
** http://eschnou.com/entry/testing-indieweb-federation-with-waterpigscouk-aaronpareckicom-and--62-24908.html
* '''[[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] using [[p3k]]'''
** http://aaronparecki.com/notes/2013/05/21/1/xkcd
* '''[[User:Sandeep.io|Sandeep Shetty]]''' using '''[[Projects#Converspace|Converspace]]'''
** http://www.sandeep.io/64
* '''[[User:WaterPigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]]''' using [[Taproot]] and marking up using .p-comment.h-entry ([http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4QgMZN/ example])
* '''[[User:Werd.io|Ben Werdmuller]]''' using [[idno]] ([http://werd.io/view/51d5097fbed7ded0633a5956#comments example])

Manually:

List of links in a [[posts#Footer_sections|post footer]] section:
* [[User:Tommorris.org|Tom Morris]] sometimes adds links+favicons to a “this post is discussed further at” section ([http://tommorris.org/posts/2506 recent example]).
* [[User:tantek.com|Tantek]] sometimes maintains a citation list of posts which link to one of his posts, e.g. http://tantek.com/2013/073/b1/silos-vs-open-social-web#silos-vs-open-social-web-comments

=== Past Practices ===
* [[User:tantek.com|Tantek]] used to maintain lists of links to his posts of people’s names linked to comment permalinks:
** 2002: [http://tantek.com/log/2002/12.html#L20021216t2238 inline list with flags to represent comment languages]
** 2003: [http://tantek.com/log/2003/12.html#L20031215t0830 inline list with some text annotations].
** 2005: [http://tantek.com/log/2005/10.html#d02t1813 block list with follow-ups to comments]

== Silos ==
In general existing blog/silo posts display comments (in either chronological or reverse chronological order) with the following details:
* '''commenter logo/photo'''
* '''commenter name'''
** '''hyperlinked to commenter profile'''
* '''full text''' of comment
* '''time''' of comment
** often in relative time since rather than absolute datetime
*** though see reasons why [http://aaronparecki.com/articles/2012/08/23/1/you-should-not-be-displaying-relative-dates you should not be displaying relative dates]
** '''hyperlinked to comment permalink'''
* '''commenter location''' (variable granularity) at time of comment writing
** '''hyperlinked''' to silo aggregation of activity at that location
* '''like/favorite button''' (to like or favorite the comment/@-reply)

=== Tumblr ===
[[Tumblr]] groups various different response types into a generic “notes” feed, at the bottom of each post ([http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/47159818629/something-something-syncing#notes example]). They show:
* The author’s username
* The author’s profile photo
=== Twitter ===
[[Twitter]] shows all tweets which are both in-reply-to a particular tweet AND contain the original tweeters @name below the tweet metadata in chronological order. They provide a “reply” box above (?) the reply feed ([https://twitter.com/wilto/status/322028394944532480 example]). The tweets have:
* The authors name
* The author’s @name
* The author’s profile photo
* A relative timestamp
* The tweet content
* A bunch of actions (on hover)
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] treats comments as completely secondary to “full” posts, showing them in chronological order beneath the post’s action bar. Facebook only show the latest ~4 comments if there are more, and display the leave-a-comment box below. They have:
* The author’s name
* The author’s profile photo
* The comment content
* A relative timestamp
* 'via mobile' if applicable
* Like button w/ like counter

== Existing specifications for display ==
Included here for thoroughness / historical purposes - a critique of existing specifications for display.

Summary: Existing specifications either don't say much or provide bad advice for what to display (if anything) in response to receiving a webmention.

=== Trackback display ===
{{main|Trackback}}
The [http://movabletype.org/documentation/trackback/specification.html TrackBack Specification] (and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trackback Trackback Wikipedia page]) doesn't appear to have any explicit implementation guidance for how to display trackback pings that have been received.

In practice however, many CMS's display trackbacks in a section explicitly labeled "Trackbacks:", and for each such trackback ping:
* title of the post that sent the trackback
* ellipsed [...] ... [...] summary text, which is nearly unreadable without more context, and doesn't even show what phrase linked to the original blog post if any.
* the overall visual design is very dated and has fallen behind modern comment presentation designs

=== Pingback display ===
{{main|pingback#Poor_display}}

See [[pingback#Poor_display|Pingback: Poor display]] for detail on how the specification itself provides very poor advice on display.

Pingback display practices appear to have been mostly based on Trackback display practices. Unfortunately, in practice Pingback displays are nearly always useless, e.g.
* https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2013/04/10/gearing-up-for-the-next-chapter/

Problems demonstrated:
* "Pingback from" is jargon - provides no value to the user - only noise
* the title of the comment blog post is useless as it provides a summary of the original blog post
* the [...] ... [...] summary text is nearly unreadable without more context, and doesn't even show what phrase linked to the original blog post
** in the first pingback, even just including the entire first paragraph of the comment post would have been better. And if it wasn't a reply then it should just be a list of related articles (date, author, linked post name, all marked up with [[h-cite]]), rather than including cryptic broken summaries.
* the overall visual design is very dated and has fallen behind modern comment presentation designs

== FAQ ==
=== Why use p-summary when I can truncate e-content ===
''Q: I guess if I grab the e-content and think it's too long, I might as well just truncate it myself. why would I need the p-summary?''

A: Because the p-summary is likely (or even just possibly) explicitly crafted by the author/publishers to be a more meaningfully truncated version of the e-content than you could yourself automatically truncate.

== Discussion ==
* Long posts where only a part of it is in-reply-to another post and a large chuck of it is a tangent should not be published as a reply/comment and instead should be published as a mention. Noting this here because this is accounted for above in the "How to display > get the text of the comment to display" section and it might wrongly send the message that (largely tangential) posts like these should be marked up with in-reply-to. (See [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-07-07/line/1373241638])
