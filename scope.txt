{{stub}}

In [[OAuth]] terminology, '''<dfn>scope</dfn>''' is a way to limit what parts of your account are accessible by third-party applications.

For example, you can choose to allow one application to read your basic profile info, while another application may be authorized to post on your behalf. 

== Scopes used by IndieWeb apps ==
* [[OwnYourGram]] requests the "post" scope when authorizing it to create photo posts on your domain.
* [[Quill]] requests the "post" scope when authorizing it to create posts on your domain.

== Scopes accepted by IndieWeb sites ==
* [[User:aaronparecki.com|aaronparecki.com]] requires the "post" scope in order to create new posts.

== Scopes used by Silos ==
=== [[Github]] ===
Github has defined many scopes for granting very granular permissions to applications. By default, applications can only read public profile info unless granted explicit scopes. Write access to any parts of a user account must be explicitly authorized with one or more scopes such as "user", "repo", or "gist". Deleting repos requires a specialized scope as well.

See the [https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes full list of Github OAuth scopes].
