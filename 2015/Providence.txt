There seemed to be a fair number of people interested in attending [[2014/Cambridge|IWC Cambridge]] but could not make it in to the city.  There are a number of locations that would make Providence possible, with several schools that might be suitable location hosts.

Currently I am looking for a [[#Organizers|co-organizer]] to help work out details of the event. - {{benthatmustbeme}}

== Location Possibilities ==
* AS220 has space downtown Providence, though I don't know if they would really have enough room for us.
* University of Rhode Island has a Providence Campus building that might be able to host.  They also have a web developement track to their CS department and Ben Roberts is an Alum.
* Brown University is close by to downtown and would certainly have the space to host.
* RISD is also close by and might be convinced to host.

== Organizers ==
* '''Organizers''': {{benthatmustbeme}} , ...
