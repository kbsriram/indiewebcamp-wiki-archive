= <span class="p-name summary">IndieWebCamp 2015</span> =

The first IndieWebCamp in Düsseldorf, but just one of many [[IndieWebCamps]]!

<div class="p-description description">
The importance of owning your data is getting more awareness. To grow it and help people gettings started, we're meeting for a bar-camp like collaboration in Düsseldorf for '''two days''' of brainstorming, working, teaching, helping.

Join us during beyond tellerrand in Düsseldorf and learn how to use open web technologies to empower and – maybe more importantly – encourage users to own their own content and identities.
