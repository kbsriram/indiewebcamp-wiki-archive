=== done ===
* <s>Visual Suggestion: remove body { background-color: #CCC; } and replace it with a white background - to open up space and make it look less like a table-based web site.</s> Done. Funny how aesthetics change over time! [[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaronparecki.com]] 22:51, 20 May 2012 (PDT)
* <s>Remove the separation of 2011 sponsors and 2012 sponsors on left sidebar</s>
* <s>Add dates to the homepage! [[Header]] would probably be the best area. e.g.: <br>June 30, 2012 - July 1, 2012 2012-07-01, daily schedule TBD.</s>
* <s>Combine Sponsorships into 1 section - use [[Title]] Sponsorship. Previous sponsors will feel good about sponsoring. Most of the sponsors want Media Sponsorships, so this will make them feel good.</s>
* <s>Create [[2012/Schedule]]</s>
* <s>Redirect [[Schedule]] to [[2012/Schedule]]</s>
