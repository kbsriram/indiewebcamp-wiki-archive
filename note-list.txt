Displaying a list of notes (tweets/status updates, i.e. short textual messages. Often highly time-context sensitive) is such a hugely common activity.

== Documented Examples ==

* [[User:waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] has a collection of annotated screenshots [http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/photos/tags-note-list/list here], including examples from:
** Facebook (Web UI)
** Twitter (Web, Mac App)
** waterpigs.co.uk
** aaronparecki.com

== Common Denominators ==

There are certain UI elements which are common to most implementations. These include:

* Profile photo (often with rounded corners)
* Full Name (often emboldened)
* Auto–linked URLs, usernames and #tags
* Dates (sometimes relative, almost always the option to see real date)

=== Less Common Elements ===

* As well as the full name, often there’s a network-specific name, or a URL on the indieweb
