'''<dfn>likes</dfn>''' are sometimes part of the information about a [[post]] displayed on the post itself, sometimes in a [[posts#Footer_sections|post footer]]. 

== IndieWeb Examples ==
There are a few IndieWeb sites which receive and handle [[webmentions]] for [[like]] posts and display them in various ways (as a [[facepile]], as a list, mixed in with other interactions like [[reposts]] and [[comments]]).

Need to add them here!
