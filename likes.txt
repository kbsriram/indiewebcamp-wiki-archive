'''<dfn>likes</dfn>''' are sometimes part of the information about a [[post]] displayed on the post itself, sometimes in a [[posts#Footer_sections|post footer]]. [[Silos]] such as [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]] show the number of likes on posts in various ways:
* "17 likes" - Instagram, for 11(?) or more likes.
* inline space/comma separated list of linked usernames/fullnames - Instagram/Facebook for some number of likes below a threshold number
* inline comma separated list of linked fullnames followed by "and 84 others like this" text, where "84" is the remaining number of likes and is linked to a modal popup that displays a list. - Facebook

There's also the notion of a ''like'' post itself:
* [[like]] post

Similar verbs/info/post-types:
* favorites (e.g. on Twitter)
* heart (sometimes just a heart symbol)
* bookmarks ([[delicious]] used to have a view of who had bookmarked a URL)
