{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>tag reply</dfn>''' is a [[response]] to another post that tags that post with one or more [[tags]].

== Why ==
Tagging others' content is a very common [[silo]] UX and practice. By using your own site to tag others' content, you "ownyourtags" even if/when the [[silo-deaths|silos die]].

== How to ==
How to mark-up a tag reply, e.g. with the tag "indiewebcamp":

Inside your usual [[h-entry]], use:
<pre>
<a class="u-tag-of" href="http://a.example.com/postpermalink37">...</a>
<span class="p-category">indiewebcamp</span>
</pre>

And then send a webmention from your tag reply permalink to <nowiki>http://a.example.com/postpermalink37</nowiki>.

Doing so will tag that postpermalink37 with the tag "indiewebcamp".
