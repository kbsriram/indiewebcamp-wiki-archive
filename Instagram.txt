[http://instagram.com/ Instagram.com] is a popular image hosting [[silo]] most well known for square [[photos]] that have been processed with an image filter. In 2013, Instagram added support for 15 second [[video]] posts.

==Exporting your data==
[http://instaport.me/ Instaport.me] and [http://flickstagram.org flickstagram.org] let you export your Instagram photos.

[http://www.freedom.io/ freedom.io] ([https://github.com/snarfed/freedom source]) can copy all of your Instagram photos and videos to [[WordPress]], [[Tumblr]], or [[Blogger]], creating a new blog post for each, with the original dates and all comments intact.

__TOC__

==POSSE==
Instagram does not have a photo upload API. However they do have comments delete / create APIs. So here's how you can fake POSSE to Instagram:

# You post to Instagram using their client app, including location information, people tags, and caption (first comment).
# Your server receives a notification of the photo post via webhook call back
# Your server copies the photo (in [[PESOS]] fashion) to your own server
## creating a permalink for the photo on your own server
## copying the location information, people tags, and caption
## adding a link to the copy of the photo on Instagram with [[rel-syndication]]
# Your server deletes the first comment on the Instagram photo
# Your server creates a new first comment (thus caption) on the Instagram photo, as you, with:
## original caption contents followed by [[permashortlink]] for the photo on your server

And bingo, you've effectively created a POSSE copy of your photo on Instagram since it now has a permashortlink back to the new "original" on your own site.

At this point you can also use a service like [[Bridgy]] to [[backfeed]] comments on the photo from Instagram to your own site.

== API ==
* Instagram's [http://instagram.com/developer official API] can create (and delete) comments and likes, but not photos.
* Work has also been done on determining its unofficial API (which is against Instagram's terms of service, but allows you to post): https://github.com/mislav/instagram/wiki
* Instagram Worm uploaded photos using private/undocumented API (needs citation)
* Instagram private API changes affect unofficial apps and photos uploaded via unofficial apps http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/30/4570610/instagram-deleting-photos-from-instance-windows-phone-app

==UX Observation==
* Videos and Photos have a very similar UI. --[[User:Bret.io|Bret.io]] 00:38, 1 July 2013 (PDT)
** Differences include a large play button on load for videos, and a caption display for photos.
