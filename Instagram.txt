'''<dfn>[http://instagram.com/ Instagram]</dfn>''' is a popular image hosting [[silo]] most well known for square [[photos]] that have been processed with an image filter. In 2013, Instagram added support for 15 second [[video]] posts.

==Exporting your data==
[http://instaport.me/ Instaport.me] and [http://flickstagram.org flickstagram.org] let you export your Instagram photos.

[http://www.freedom.io/ freedom.io] ([https://github.com/snarfed/freedom source]) can copy all of your Instagram photos and videos to [[WordPress]], [[Tumblr]], or [[Blogger]], creating a new blog post for each, with the original dates and all comments intact.

==POSSE==
Instagram does not have a photo upload API. However they do have comments delete / create APIs. So here's how you can fake POSSE to Instagram:

# You post to Instagram using their client app, including location information, people tags, and caption (first comment).
# Your server receives a notification of the photo post via webhook call back
# Your server copies the photo (in [[PESOS]] fashion) to your own server
## creating a permalink for the photo on your own server
## copying the location information, people tags, and caption
## adding a link to the copy of the photo on Instagram with [[rel-syndication]]
# Your server deletes the first comment on the Instagram photo
# Your server creates a new first comment (thus caption) on the Instagram photo, as you, with:
## original caption contents followed by [[permashortlink]] for the photo on your server

And bingo, you've effectively created a POSSE copy of your photo on Instagram since it now has a permashortlink back to the new "original" on your own site.

At this point you can also use a service like [[Bridgy]] to [[backfeed]] comments on the photo from Instagram to your own site.

=== IndieWeb Implementations ===
* [[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]]'s [[OwnYourGram]] service provides PESOS from Instagram for any site that supports micropub.
* ...

=== Manual Notes POSSE ===
Some users manually POSSE occasional [[notes]] posts to Instagram, e.g.:
* Original: https://twitter.com/ClaireWyckoff/status/532912362991648768 <blockquote>Worst way to die: you're mauled by a zombie and as you're about to turn you realize he's wearing Ed Hardy.</blockquote>
* POSSE copy: [http://instagram.com/p/vWDDFlyTL8/ <img src="http://photos-e.ak.instagram.com/hphotos-ak-xpf1/10693307_1492129594399372_2131465102_n.jpg" style="width:256px"/>]

As of this edit:
* the original has only *2* favorites. (2,346 followers on account)
* the POSSE copy: *130* likes and *3* comments. (14,512 followers on account)
For some reason, POSSE copies, even of *notes*, on Instagram receive more [[interactions]] per follower.

Hypothesis: the Instagram [[reader]] experience is so much smoother and nicer that it tends to encourage more use and thus more interactions.

== API ==
=== Supposed Features and Limitations ===
* Instagram's [http://instagram.com/developer official API] can potentially create (and delete) comments and likes, but not photos.
=== Like ===
{{snarfed}} has found that Instagram's API now supports progammatically "liking" photos (used to 400).
=== Location ===
* [http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/locations/ location of photos] - indicates use of [[Facebook]] places ID, [[Foursquare]] venue id (both v1 and v2 of their API)
=== Cannot Comment ===
{{snarfed}} has found that authing with scope=comments works, but the API call still 400s.

According to [http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/comments/#post_media_comments Instagram's API documentation],  their commenting API only works for those who are whitelisted. Unfortunately the [http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/comments/#post_media_comments criteria for application for whitelisting] are very restrictive.

=== Unofficial ===
* Work has also been done on determining its unofficial API (which is against Instagram's terms of service, but allows you to post): https://github.com/mislav/instagram/wiki
* Instagram Worm uploaded photos using private/undocumented API (needs citation)
* Instagram private API changes affect unofficial apps and photos uploaded via unofficial apps http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/30/4570610/instagram-deleting-photos-from-instance-windows-phone-app

==UX Observation==
* Videos and Photos have a very similar UI. --[[User:Bret.io|Bret.io]] 00:38, 1 July 2013 (PDT)
** Differences include a large play button on load for videos, and a caption display for photos.

== Criticism ==
===Bad Silo Interop with Twitter===
Shortly after it was purchased by Facebook, [http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/09/it-appears-that-instagram-photos-arent-showing-up-in-twitter-streams-at-all/ Instagram stopped including Twitter metadata] on their photo pages, so Twitter Cards no longer show image previews for Instagram photos.

Instagram drives more traffic to their site, at the cost of a worse experience for users.

Using [[OwnYourGram]] or another method of PESOSing your photos out of Instagram, you can control how your photos are shared on other silos like Twitter. (e.g., by including Twitter metadata, or by posting the photos directly).

===Downtime===
* 2014-04-12 Instagram feeds were down as reported in this @Instagram tweet which itself has been deleted!

* 2014-08-22 various times throughout the day - "news" activity on photos feature was down with user-unfriendly [[nginx]] default error message:

=== Switch from Foursquare to Facebook venues ===
Some time in 2014-05, Instagram switched from using [[Foursquare]]'s venue database (e.g. in the iOS app UI) to using [[Facebook]]'s places database.

This has resulted in:
* fewer venue matches (often completely missing venues that were present on Foursquare)
* less accurate venue locations such as misspellings, "venues" with varied granularity (business vs neighborhood)
* loss of venue information when cross-posting from Instagram to Foursquare (i.e. checks you into the wrong location, or a generic neighborhood rather than a specific venue)

=== Lack of privacy of location data ===
When posting a photo to Instagram, if "add to photo map" is enabled (even if no venue is chosen) then the exact lat/lng of the photo is recorded. When viewing the single photo you won't see the location of it. However, when viewing the person's user profile you can switch to the map view and see their photos all on a map. 

[[File:instagram-map-aaronpk-far.png|300px]]
[[File:instagram-map-aaronpk-close.png|300px]]

The map shows photos as clusters, and zooming in will expand the clusters into smaller clusters until finally individual photos appear on the map. 

It is relatively easy to figure out the approximate location of someone's work or home by looking for these clusters.

=== Uneditable Custom Locations ===
When adding a photo at a venue that doesn't exist, it is possible to create a "custom location", which is unfortunately not editable from that point on. 

One potential up-side is when searching for venues, your custom locations now show up at the top of the list without needing a round-trip to the server to search.

[[File:instagram-custom-location-search.png]]

Creating this custom location prompts only for the name, the exact geo location is added automatically, meaning it is not possible to adjust the specific location of the venue.

=== Censorship/removal of otherwise innocuous material ===

* Instagram has [http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/instagram-removes-photo-gay-newlyweds-kissing030714 reportedly removed a photograph of a gay couple kissing at their wedding] as "inappropriate".
* Instagram's removal of sexual content has been criticised as [http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/10/30/instagram-s-sex-censorship-is-inconsistent-and-hilarious.html being inconsistently enforced].
