'''<dfn>[http://instagram.com/ Instagram]</dfn>''' is a popular image hosting [[silo]] most well known for square [[photos]] that have been processed with an image filter. In 2013, Instagram added support for 15 second [[video]] posts.

==Exporting your data==
[http://instaport.me/ Instaport.me] and [http://flickstagram.org flickstagram.org] let you export your Instagram photos.

[http://www.freedom.io/ freedom.io] ([https://github.com/snarfed/freedom source]) can copy all of your Instagram photos and videos to [[WordPress]], [[Tumblr]], or [[Blogger]], creating a new blog post for each, with the original dates and all comments intact.

__TOC__

==POSSE==
Instagram does not have a photo upload API. However they do have comments delete / create APIs. So here's how you can fake POSSE to Instagram:

# You post to Instagram using their client app, including location information, people tags, and caption (first comment).
# Your server receives a notification of the photo post via webhook call back
# Your server copies the photo (in [[PESOS]] fashion) to your own server
## creating a permalink for the photo on your own server
## copying the location information, people tags, and caption
## adding a link to the copy of the photo on Instagram with [[rel-syndication]]
# Your server deletes the first comment on the Instagram photo
# Your server creates a new first comment (thus caption) on the Instagram photo, as you, with:
## original caption contents followed by [[permashortlink]] for the photo on your server

And bingo, you've effectively created a POSSE copy of your photo on Instagram since it now has a permashortlink back to the new "original" on your own site.

At this point you can also use a service like [[Bridgy]] to [[backfeed]] comments on the photo from Instagram to your own site.

* ...

== API ==
* Instagram's [http://instagram.com/developer official API] can create (and delete) comments and likes, but not photos.
* Work has also been done on determining its unofficial API (which is against Instagram's terms of service, but allows you to post): https://github.com/mislav/instagram/wiki
* Instagram Worm uploaded photos using private/undocumented API (needs citation)
* Instagram private API changes affect unofficial apps and photos uploaded via unofficial apps http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/30/4570610/instagram-deleting-photos-from-instance-windows-phone-app
* [http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/locations/ location of photos] - indicates use of [[Facebook]] places ID, [[Foursquare]] venue id (both v1 and v2 of their API)

==UX Observation==
* Videos and Photos have a very similar UI. --[[User:Bret.io|Bret.io]] 00:38, 1 July 2013 (PDT)
** Differences include a large play button on load for videos, and a caption display for photos.

=== Switch from Foursquare to Facebook venues ===
Some time in 2014-05, Instagram switched from using [[Foursquare]]'s venue database (e.g. in the iOS app UI) to using [[Facebook]]'s places database.

This has resulted in:
* fewer venue matches (often completely missing venues that were present on Foursquare)
* less accurate venue locations such as misspellings, "venues" with varied granularity (business vs neighborhood)
* loss of venue information when cross-posting from Instagram to Foursquare (i.e. checks you into the wrong location, or a generic neighborhood rather than a specific venue)

=== Uneditable Custom Locations ===
When adding a photo at a venue that doesn't exist, it is possible to create a "custom location", which is unfortunately not editable from that point on. 

One potential up-side is when searching for venues, your custom locations now show up at the top of the list without needing a round-trip to the server to search.

Creating this custom location prompts only for the name, the exact geo location is added automatically, meaning it is not possible to adjust the specific location of the venue.
