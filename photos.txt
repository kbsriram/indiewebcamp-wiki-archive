A '''<dfn>photo</dfn>''' is a [[post]] whose primary content is a photograph or other image.

A [[photo upload]] is typically how photo posts are created.

== How ==
There are different approaches to posting photos. E.g.
* As a [[note]] with a primary image
* As an image, with text (caption) only following
* Hosting variations - image files hosted on
** your primary webhost/domain
** a "photos." subdomain of your domain that maps to a cloud/CDN service like [[Amazon]] [[S3]] or [[Akamai]].
** as Creative Commons licensed content uploaded to [[Wikimedia]]

== Why ==
You should own your photos like you own any other content you create. Many photos sites have [[site-deaths|gone down]] over the years, taking invaluable personal memories with them.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} has been posting photos to his own site since [[2014/SF|IndieWebCamp SF]] on 2014-03-08, using [[OwnYourGram]] to turn [[Instagram]] into a publishing client.
* e.g. http://aaronparecki.com/notes/2014/05/06/3/iiw-indieweb

=== Barnaby Walters ===
[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] uses [[Taproot]] to post photos on [http://waterpigs.co.uk waterpigs.co.uk] since at least [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/686/ 2012-12-13] as notes with images in.

=== Ben Werdmuller ===
[[User:Werd.io|Ben Werdmuller]] uses [[idno]] to post photos (including taking them with a mobile web upload interface that uses the camera!) on [http://werd.io/ werd.io] (since ????-??-??), and [[POSSE]]s them to [[Facebook]] and [[Flickr]] (since ????-??-??)
* e.g. ??? a photo post permalink on werd.io
* mobile photography and posting demonstrated live at IndieWebCamp [[2013]] in Portland.

=== Ryan Barrett ===
[[User:Snarfed.org|Ryan Barrett]] uses [[WordPress]] to post photos on [https://snarfed.org/pictures snarfed.org/pictures] since around [https://snarfed.org/draw_group 2003-03-06].

== Silos ==
The following [[silos]] specialize in photo posting/hosting/sharing:
* [[Flickr]]
* [[Instagram]]
* [[Wikimedia Commons]]

In addition, the following silos support photo posts in addition to other types of posts:
* [[Facebook]]
* [[Google+]]

== Brainstorming ==
=== People Tagging ===
[[User:benwerd.com|Ben Werdmuller]] wondered if you could tag people in photos by linking to their profiles using HTML imagemaps (!) and marking up the imagemap links with microformats. That might look something like:

<code><img src="some_photo.jpg" alt="Tantek, Aaron and Amber!" usemap="#peeps" class="u-photo">

<map name="peeps">

<area shape="circle" coords="124,58,8" class="microcard h-card u-url" href="http://tantek.com" alt="Tantek Ã‡elik">

<area shape="rect" coords="0,0,82,126" class="microcard h-card u-url"  href="http://aaronparecki.com" alt="Aaron Parecki">

<area shape="circle" coords="90,58,3" class="microcard h-card u-url" href="http://caseorganic.com" alt="Amber Case">

</map></code>

However, because the HTML syntax of imagemaps sits outside the actual image tag, it may be worth adding a microformat to the map itself.

=== POSSE ===
[[POSSE]]ing photo posts makes sense certainly to photo [[silos]] like:
* [[Flickr]]
* [[Instagram]] (as much as you can fake a POSSE post to Instagram)
* [[Wikimedia Commons]] (as a [[commons]] rather than a silo, it may make sense to start POSSEing here as a backup/distribution/CDN mechanism)

In addition, it makes sense to consider POSSEing to generic silos, despite the fact that they will only retain a (likely) lower resolution copy of your photo:
* [[Twitter]] - as a native Twitter photo tweet, using TwitterAPI <code>update_with_media</code>
* [[Facebook]]

[[Bridgy]] Publish may help with POSSEing pictures to Twitter and FB. This is currently on the Bridgy todo list:
* https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/85

==== Why POSSE rather than TwitterCard ====
(Not sure if this belongs here or on [[Twitter]] page, but capturing as part of this for now.)
Advantages to POSSEing actual photos to Twitter, rather than just a link to a photo post on your site with Twitter [[Cards]] metacrap markup:
* Further distribute the use of Twitter kind of like a CDN for your photos
* People see a larger version of the photo via a phototweet than a Twittercard
* Usual avoid [[metacrap]] (silo-specific meta tags) advantage
* Photo tweets appear inline in tweet list views (e.g. Twitter timeline / homepage) whereas twitter cards won't appear inline automatically (require twiddling open).
* Photo tweets work immediately, whereas photo cards require that Twitter whitelist your domain for cards in general (and maybe in particular for photo cards?)
* Using the TwitterAPI hides the proprietariness, whereas using twittercards means your own website has proprietary metacrap on it
* Twittercards set a worse example (proprietary metacrap) for others that may view source

== Software ==
Software you can install on your IndieWeb server to host your own photos
=== Trovebox ===
{{main|Trovebox}}
Trovebox (formerly <span id="OpenPhoto">OpenPhoto</span>) is software you can install to post and share your own photos. There are several [[Trovebox#Criticism|documented criticisms]] of this software as it has been used by people in the community.
