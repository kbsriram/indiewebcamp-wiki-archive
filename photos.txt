A '''<dfn>photo</dfn>''' is a [[post]] whose primary content is a photograph or other image, with an optional caption.

A [[photo upload]] is typically how photo posts are created.

== How ==
There are different approaches to posting photos. E.g.
* As a [[note]] with a primary image
* As an image, with text (caption) only following
** the image is the focus of the post, and text is in service of the image.
* Hosting variations - image files hosted on
** your primary webhost/domain
** a "photos." subdomain of your domain that maps to a cloud/CDN service like [[Amazon]] [[S3]] or [[Akamai]].
** as Creative Commons licensed content uploaded to [[Wikimedia]]

== Why ==
You should own your photos like you own any other content you create. Many photos sites have [[site-deaths|gone down]] over the years, taking invaluable personal memories with them.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Sorted by earliest photo posts first.

=== Ryan Barrett ===
[[User:Snarfed.org|Ryan Barrett]] uses [[WordPress]] to post photos on [https://snarfed.org/pictures snarfed.org/pictures] since around [https://snarfed.org/draw_group 2003-03-06].

=== Bret Comnes ===
[[User:bret.io|Bret Comnes]] uses [[gitpub]] to post photos directly on bret.io [http://bret.io/2013/02/26/pictures-from-portland/ since 2013-02-26], and started posting photos using [[ownyourgram]] on [http://bret.io/2014/05/18/ownyourgram/ 2014-05-18].  E.g.
* http://bret.io/2013/02/26/pictures-from-portland/ (first photo post)
* http://bret.io/2014/05/18/ownyourgram/ (first photo post with ownyourgram)

=== Ben Werdmuller ===
[[User:Werd.io|Ben Werdmuller]] uses [[idno]] to post photos (including taking them with a mobile web upload interface that uses the camera!) on [http://werd.io/ werd.io] (since ????-??-??), and [[POSSE]]s them to [[Facebook]] and [[Flickr]] (since ????-??-??)
* e.g. ??? a photo post permalink on werd.io
* mobile photography and posting demonstrated live at IndieWebCamp [[2013]] in Portland.

* http://adactio.com/notes/7021 - first photo POSSEd to both Twitter and Flickr:
** https://twitter.com/adactio/status/486617601167339521
** https://www.flickr.com/photos/adactio/14604446101

== Notes with photos examples ==
Not quite photo posts, but similar, [[notes]] with embedded photos are another approach to photo-like posts.

=== Barnaby Walters ===
[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] uses [[Taproot]] to post photos on [http://waterpigs.co.uk waterpigs.co.uk] since at least [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/686/ 2012-12-13] as notes with embedded images.

== Discussion ==
* {{gRegor}}: I don't understand the distinction between 'photo' and 'note with photo.' It was suggested in chat by [[User:Mowens.com|mko]] that a 'photo' post would be a photo with no other content. However, this page indicates caption text may follow the photo. Per discussion, the caption would be the p-summary/p-name of the photo post. This seems to make it no different than a regular note, then, as far as microformat parsing. Example: http://gregorlove.com/notes/2014/07/15/2/ — [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-07-15#t1405445144 IRC log]
** Per further discussion, mko explained that the caption would not appear in the e-content, as it does in my example. He offered these code examples to demonstrate the difference: https://gist.github.com/mko/f05e8cb0d2423f6deaa7

* On a photo post, text is directly "related to the photo", where text in a note can be "conversational" or tangential. <blockquote>&lt;mko> Another example, from my own experience. I was the design lead at hi5. We did research into how users were using the Photos feature versus the Status Update feature (which had the ability to post a photo). Users posted photos without any text the vast majority of the time. When users posted status updates with photos, on the other hand, they almost never did so without accompanying text. On top of that, we found that when there was text accompanying a photo in the Photos section, it was almost always a caption related to the photo (with very few exceptions), whereas those in a status update that would go on the Friend Feed typically was conversational and not directly related to the photo.</blockquote>[http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-07-15#t1405447134]

* [[User:kartikprabhu.com| Kartik]]: I do not understand what would be the UI/UX difference in posting/reading a "photo with caption" vs "note with photo" ? Some examples (silo/indieweb) distinguishing these cases would be good.
** [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]]: I would consider [https://kylewm.com/note/2014/05/05/1 this post about going to a museum] a note with a photo that is not a photo post &mdash; The text stands alone; the image is secondary[[File:kylewm-note-with-photo-2014-07-15.png|none|thumb|A note with a photo]]

== Silos ==
The following [[silos]] specialize in photo posting/hosting/sharing:
* [[Flickr]]
* [[Instagram]]
* [[Wikimedia Commons]]

In addition, the following silos support photo posts in addition to other types of posts:
* [[Facebook]]
* [[Google+]]

Here are some notes on specific silo treatment of photos:

=== Facebook ===
With Facebook, you have the options of:
* creating an actual [[photo]] post (preferred)
** Note that the [[POSSE_to_Facebook#See_Original]] trick does not work with photo posts
* or posting a status update ([[note]]) and linking to the original photo or if you're linking to a permalink on your own site (e.g. as part of [[POSSE]]ing), optionally using [[OGP]] to specify the image to use for a preview.<br>[[File:facebook-post-with-preview-image.png|none|thumb|Facebook note with preview image]]
Creating an actual photo post looks much better.

== Brainstorming ==
{{main|photo brainstorming}}
=== People Tagging ===
[[User:benwerd.com|Ben Werdmuller]] wondered if you could tag people in photos by linking to their profiles using HTML imagemaps (!) and marking up the imagemap links with microformats. That might look something like:

<code><img src="some_photo.jpg" alt="Tantek, Aaron and Amber!" usemap="#peeps" class="u-photo">

<map name="peeps">

<area shape="circle" coords="124,58,8" class="microcard h-card u-url" href="http://tantek.com" alt="Tantek Çelik">

<area shape="rect" coords="0,0,82,126" class="microcard h-card u-url"  href="http://aaronparecki.com" alt="Aaron Parecki">

<area shape="circle" coords="90,58,3" class="microcard h-card u-url" href="http://caseorganic.com" alt="Amber Case">

</map></code>

However, because the HTML syntax of imagemaps sits outside the actual image tag, it may be worth adding a microformat to the map itself.

=== POSSE ===
[[POSSE]]ing photo posts makes sense certainly to photo [[silos]] like:
* [[Flickr]]
* [[Instagram]] (as much as you can fake a POSSE post to Instagram)
* [[Wikimedia Commons]] (as a [[commons]] rather than a silo, it may make sense to start POSSEing here as a backup/distribution/CDN mechanism)

In addition, it makes sense to consider POSSEing to generic silos, despite the fact that they will only retain a (likely) lower resolution copy of your photo:
* [[Twitter]] - as a native Twitter photo tweet, using TwitterAPI <code>update_with_media</code>
* [[Facebook]]

[[Bridgy]] Publish may help with POSSEing pictures to Twitter and FB. This is currently on the Bridgy todo list:
* https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/85

==== Distinguishing Photos from Notes ====

[[Bridgy]] Publish has a concrete use-case where it would be useful to mechanically differentiate posts where the photo is primary, vs. notes with an included image that is not the focus of the note. Photo posts should be POSSEd as '''native''' photo post types on [[Facebook]] and included as attached media on [[Twitter]]. POSSEd notes would prefer to link to the original post, and possibly include the image as a "preview".

The problem is that both types have the same mf2 representation: p-name/e-content for caption and u-photo for the image.

Simplest implementation would just treat all <strike>posts</strike> notes with a u-photo as photo posts.

[https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/85 Also tracked in GitHub.]

==== Why POSSE rather than TwitterCard ====
(Not sure if this belongs here or on [[Twitter]] page, but capturing as part of this for now.)
Advantages to POSSEing actual photos to Twitter, rather than just a link to a photo post on your site with Twitter [[Cards]] metacrap markup:
* Further distribute the use of Twitter kind of like a CDN for your photos
* People see a larger version of the photo via a phototweet than a Twittercard
* Usual avoid [[metacrap]] (silo-specific meta tags) advantage
* Photo tweets appear inline in tweet list views (e.g. Twitter timeline / homepage) whereas twitter cards won't appear inline automatically (require twiddling open).
* Photo tweets work immediately, whereas photo cards require that Twitter whitelist your domain for cards in general (and maybe in particular for photo cards?)
* Using the TwitterAPI hides the proprietariness, whereas using twittercards means your own website has proprietary metacrap on it
* Twittercards set a worse example (proprietary metacrap) for others that may view source

=== Hosting ===
* When I start hosting my own photos, I have thought about using the Coral CDN. http://www.coralcdn.org/ {{gRegor}}

== Software ==
Software you can install on your IndieWeb server to host your own photos

* GNU [http://mediagoblin.org/ Mediagoblin]
* [[Trovebox]] (formerly <span id="OpenPhoto">OpenPhoto</span>)
