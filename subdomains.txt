{{stub}} 

While having your own domain is great, sometimes it makes more sense to have your primary identity on the web represented on a sub-domain.


== Reasons to use a subdomain ==
* When sharing a domain of your last name with family members
* The primary function of your domain serves additional purposes other than representing your identity on the web.

==== Examples of intelligent subdomain use ====
* sandeep.shetty.in

== Reasons not to use a subdomain ==
* Taking advantage of free hosting that offers free subdomains leaves a lot of control of the domain in the hands of the host, putting your url at [http://indiewebcamp.com/why#Why_Indie_Web risk of a whole lot of things].

==== Examples of risky subdomain use as your primary identity on the web ====
* Your University's provided path or subdomain, as these tend to change over time
