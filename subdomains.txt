http://indiewebcamp.com/subdomains

Most writing about IndieWeb assumes people will have their own second-level domain, like tantek.com, used just for themselves.  This page is about alternatives to that vision.


== Paths on a Shared Domain ==

Example: http://example.com/alice

Pro: reduced cost and admin effort

Con: alice is locked into example.com; there's no way alice can leave

Con: example.com can't allow alice to host arbitrary content withouth endangering their other users, because of the browser same-origin policy.   (see [[lj2006]] for Livejournal's having to deal with this in 2006.)

== Subdomains ==

Example: http://alice.example.com or http://alice.people.example.com

Pro: reduced cost and admin effort

Con: alice is dependent on example.com, although the dependency can potentially be very small, with example.com just managing a DNS "A" record for alice, pointing to alice's server.

== Conclusion ==

It seems okay to use subdomains as long as the 2nd-level domain holder makes a sufficient guarantee of subdomain portability.  That is, they must let users change their DNS "A" records in perpetuity for no more than a minimal charge.

This seems reasonable with families, and perhaps also with fraternities, colleges, and other organizations to which one naturally has a life-long membership.

At some point, there may be companies willing to offer this kind of service with a plausible very-long-term commitment.


Note that taking advantage of free hosting that offers free subdomains leaves a lot of control of the domain in the hands of the host, putting your url at [http://indiewebcamp.com/why#Why_Indie_Web risk of a whole lot of things].   Similarly, universities, etc, tend to not provide long-term stability.
