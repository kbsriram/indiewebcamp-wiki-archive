'''<dfn>FeedBurner</dfn>''' is a service that aggregates [[feeds]] and provides analytics to publishers.

FeedBurner was purchased by [[Google]] which now calls it "Google feedburner".

Google shutdown FeedBurner APIs shut down on 2012-10-20 (per https://developers.google.com/feedburner/ ). See also: http://pleasedontkillfeedburner.com/

== Leaving Feedburner ==
Google has recently (as of August the 14th 2013) made an interesting change to Feedburner that makes it easier for a site to take back its feed. In the past, Feedburner would redirect requests to a deleted feed to the original one for 1 month. It now offers a permanent redirection, which makes leaving easier.

Once permanent redirection is selected, site authors should add a header or footer to their feed in order to advertise the new address at least during the first months, to let their subscribers change the address in their feed readers.

To remove your feed from Feedburner, login into your Feedburner console, select the feed to remove, and click on "delete".

Before submiting, don't forget to check the "With permanent redirection" checkbox.
