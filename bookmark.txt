* [[User:iamshane.com|Shane Becker]] posts bookmarks on [http://iamshane.com/bookmarks iamshane.com/bookmarks]. He sub-categorizes them by adding a "fave", "read-later", "watch-later" or "listen-later" tags to a bookmark post. The linked title of a bookmark post goes to the bookmarked URL, not the bookmark post's permalink. Bookmark posts have a '''⇜''' before the title to help indicate that the link goes to an external site. The '''⇜''' is applied using a CSS :before selector and a content property to keep it out of the actual HTML/microformat content. These bookmark posts contain:
** URL
** Title
** tags
** Excerpt (optiona)
** Description (optiona)
