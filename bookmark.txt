A '''<dfn>bookmark</dfn>''' (or <dfn>linkblog</dfn>) is a [[post]] that is typically comprised of a URL and optional text accompanying it. The accompanying text is often the "title" of the HTML document at the URL, or a shortened version thereof, or author-chosen description of the URL. Bookmark posts sometimes have [[tags]] as well.

=== Shane Becker ===
[[User:iamshane.com|Shane Becker]] posts bookmarks on [http://iamshane.com/bookmarks iamshane.com/bookmarks] since ????-??-??. He sub-categorizes them by adding a "fave", "read-later", "watch-later" or "listen-later" tag to a bookmark post. The linked title of a bookmark post goes to the bookmarked URL, not the bookmark post's permalink. Bookmark posts have a '''⇜''' before the title to help indicate that the link goes to an external site. The '''⇜''' is applied using a CSS :before selector and a content property to keep it out of the actual HTML/microformat content. These bookmark posts contain:
* URL
* Title
* tags
* Excerpt (optional)
* Description (optional)

== Similar Post Kinds ==
Text of a '''bookmark post''' is most often the title of the linked resource, i.e. created by the author of the linked resource, rather than the person posting the bookmark post.

This is a key distinction between a bookmark and other kinds of posts.

=== Reply ===
The text of a ''[[reply]]'' is written by the person posting the reply, and often a new statement in response to the original post.

If the text of a bookmark post is written as commentary on the bookmark, then that should likely be a reply post instead.

=== Repost ===
The text of a [[repost]] comes from the entirety of the <em>content</em> of a bookmark rather than the name or title of the bookmarked resource.

If the text of a bookmark post is the entirety of the contents of the thing that is bookmarked, then that should likely be a repost instead.

=== Quotation ===
The text of a [[quotation]] comes from part of the <em>content</em> of a bookmark rather than the name or title of the bookmarked resource.

If the text of a bookmark post is merely part of the contents of the thing that is bookmarked, then that should likely be a quotation instead.
