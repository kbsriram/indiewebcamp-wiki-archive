== What is the IndieWeb? ==
The IndieWeb is a people-focused alternative to the ‘corporate web’. 
{| class="wikitable" style="background-color:#F8FCF7; border: 1px #eaf6e8 solid; padding: 6px;" cellpadding="10"
! width="64" style="vertical-align:top;" |[[file:icon_4611.png|48px]]
| '''Your content is yours'''<br>When you post something on the web, it should belong to you, not a corporation. Too many companies have gone out of business and [[site-deaths|lost all of their users’ data]]. By joining the IndieWeb, your content stays yours and in your control.<br><br>
|-
! width="64" style="vertical-align:top;" |[[file:icon_31635.png|48px]]
| '''You are better connected'''<br>Your articles and status messages can [[POSSE|go to all services]], not just one, allowing you to engage with everyone. Even replies and likes on other services can [[backfeed|come back to your site]] so they’re all in one place.<br><br>
|-
! width="64" style="vertical-align:top;" background-color: #f9f9f9; |[[file:icon_2003.png|48px]]
|'''You are in control'''<br>You can post anything you want, in any format you want, with no one monitoring you. In addition, you share simple readable links such as ''example.com/ideas''. These links are [[permalinks|permanent]] and will always work.<br><br>
|}

=== Beyond Blogging and Decentralization ===
The IndieWeb effort is [[different]] from previous efforts/communities:
* '''[[Principles]]''' over project-centrism. Others assume a [[monoculture]] of one project for all. We are developing a [[principles#Plurality|plurality of projects]].
* '''[[Selfdogfood]]''' instead of email. Show before tell. Prioritize by scratching your own itches, [[creator|creating]], iterating on your own site.
* '''[[Design]]''' first, formats second. Focus on good UX & selfdogfood prototypes to create minimum necessary formats &amp; protocols.

The third IndieWebCamp in sunny Brighton - one of many IndieWeb [[events]].

<div class="p-description description">
Own your data.

Rather than posting content on third-party silos of content, we should all own the content we're creating. Publish on your own domain, and syndicate out to silos.

Join us at the Clearleft offices in Brighton for '''two days''' of BarCamp-style collaboration and discussions of how to use open web technologies to empower users to own their own identities & content, and advance the state of the indie web.
