A '''<dfn>podcast</dfn>''' is an episodic series of audio/video files that can be subscribed to and downloaded.

== Why ==
Why should you have a podcast? Some people like listening to them when:
* walking / running / [[exercising]] in general
* driving, e.g. on a roadtrip
* commuting (by any method)

== How ==
How to best publish a podcast... ?

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb examples of personal podcast publishing.

* {{benwerd}} has published podcasts on werd.io using [[Known]]
** First 2014-11-02: http://werd.io/2014/the-top-podcasts-are-professional-but-everyones-voice-should-be
** An RSS feed of all posts tagged #podcastsunday: http://werd.io/content/all/?q=%23podcastsunday&_t=rss

== Distribution ==
There are number of services for distributing your podcast without having to make copies (thus different from [[POSSE]] / syndication in general).

=== Huffduffer ===
[[Huffduffer]] is a bookmarking service for podcasts and audio / music / speech in general.

To submit your podcast to Huffduffer, create an account, submit your podcast with various tags.

Users of Huffduffer can then find your podcast by tag.

=== iTunes ===
[[iTunes]] is a service and application from [[Apple]] for music, video, podcasts and other multimedia. Podcasts distributed by iTunes are made easily discoverable and subscribable in:
* MacOS "iTunes" application
* iOS "Podcasts" application

==== Submitting to iTunes for distribution ====
See: [https://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/specs.html How to Submit a Podcast] at apple.com

When submitting a podcast URL to iTunes, be sure to submit a URL on a domain that you control. For example, if using [[Libsyn]] to host your podcast mp3s, don't submit the RSS URL that they provide. Instead, host a page on your domain that sends a "302 Found" temporary redirect to the Libsyn URL. 

== Changing podcast hosting providers ==

=== Podcast URL under your control ===

If your podcast URL is on your own domain, then you can just change the 302 redirect to point to the new hosting provider.

=== Podcast URL not under your control ===
If your podcast URL is not on your own domain, then the ability to change your URL is limited by whether your current host allows you to.

Libsyn has a writeup of [http://support.libsyn.com/faqs/changing-your-feed-url-in-itunes/ how to change your feed URL]. 

Essentially the process involves setting an additional property in the feed URL.
