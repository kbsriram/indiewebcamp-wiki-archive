<dfn>Onboarding</dfn> refers to the first experience a user has when installing, configuring, and first logging into an application. A great onboarding process walks the user through all the required steps (e.g. configuring the database or file system location, setting the base URL of the site, etc.), helps spot 

== IndieWeb Examples ==

* [[Known]]
** On first installing Known, the user is directed to a setup page that checks for required PHP dependencies, helps them configure a database connection and creates database tables if necessary, and guides them through configuring the appearance of the site.
** Once installed and running, a friendly robot named "Aleph" offers to help with more advanced usage and topics (add screenshot)

* [[OwnYourGram]] and [[Quill]] are [[micropub]] clients that double as guides to setting up micropub on your IndieWeb site.  New users walk through the process of setting up authorization, token, and micropub endpoints, with thorough documentation and tests with helpful feedback along the way.

* [[Bridgy]]. Once users have given Bridgy read access to their social media account, it attempts to detect potential configuration problems (e.g., no webmention endpoint) and give the user a bright yellow heads up.

== Brainstorming ==

=== IndieAuth Chicken or Egg ===

Personal website software that uses [[IndieAuth]] for user logins (e.g. [[Red Wind]]) faces a potential "[[chicken]] or the egg" problem.

* To set the site URL, add an h-card, configure rel=me's for social media profiles, etc. the user must log in as an administrator.
* To log in as an administrator via IndieAuth, the user needs an personal website with rel=me's that link to their social media profiles. 

Just to test and develop locally requires the user ''have'' an IndieAuth-capable website.

Some ideas:

* All configuration via text files or environment variables.
* Provide alternative password based login.
** Only in development mode?
* Do not require a login at all ''until'' the site is configured and IndieAuth is successful.
