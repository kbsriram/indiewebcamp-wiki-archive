'''<dfn>[https://www.libravatar.org/ Libravatar]</dfn>''' is a protocol [http://wiki.libravatar.org/api/ specification] for fetching avatar images for E-Mail addresses and [[OpenID]]s in a decentralized way.

It is also an open source service to host a profile photo (avatar) for e-mail addresses and OpenIDs. The photos can then automatically be displayed on your posts and comments on any website that supports it.

In contrast to [[Gravatar]], which is a centralized service, libravatar is decentralized - everyone can host his own avatar server. [http://wiki.libravatar.org/running_your_own/ Multiple server implementations] are available.
