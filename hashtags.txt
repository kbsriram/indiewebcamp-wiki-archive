{{stub}}

'''<dfn>hashtags</dfn>''' are the use of the hash "#" symbol followed immediately by a word/phrase/abbreviation to explicitly denote a topic inline in a [[post]]. Popularized on [[Twitter]], they're now everpresent on [[Instagram]] and other [[silos]] where they link to aggregations of posts inside those silos with those tags.

This page is specifically about '''hashtags'''. For general concept of tags and tagging content, see:
* '''[[tags]]'''

== Markup ==

Use [http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag rel=tag] on hashtag links. If you're using [[h-entry]] (you really should be ;) then use p-category as well.

== Discovery ==
How do we discover indieweb posts tagged with a particular tag? It’s a problem well suited to centralised hubs.

Could we get services like tagboard to start indexing indieweb posts, not just posts in silos?

== IndieWeb examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
[[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] uses [[p3k]] on aaronparecki.com to auto-link hashtags on his posts to his own [[tag]] aggregation page since 2013-03-08.

=== Barnaby Walters ===
[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] uses [[Taproot]] on waterpigs.co.uk to auto-link to a /tags page containing a list of links to content which is tagged with that tag (as per hypermedia API design, [http://waterpigs.co.uk/tags/music example]) since [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/285/ 2012-09-22]. This probably needs some js/iframe goodness to pull that content in --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 05:57, 19 April 2013 (PDT)

== FAQ ==
=== Autolinking hashtags ===
'''Where should hashtags in [[posts]] be auto-linked to?'''

Link them to a page on your site which aggregates posts tagged with that tag. It’s fine for this to just redirect to, for example, a google search of your site for that tag, but by always linking to a URL you control you can improve it/self-host it later.

== Silo support ==
Silos that support hashtag aggregation on their own content.

Single post-type hashtag aggregations:
* [[Twitter]] - [[notes]] (with embedded media, but not displayed by default, you have to twiddle them open)
* [[Flickr]] - [[photos]] (and [[videos]], but they don't play on tag aggregation pages, so effectively they're just images as well - poster-images from videos)

Composite post-type hashtag aggregations:
* [[Tumblr]] - Tumbler has an amazing display of hetergenous post types in a single tag aggregation grid.
** e.g. http://www.tumblr.com/tagged/cortexiphan shows a tag grid of the following post types
** [[photo]], including animated GIFs
** [[video]]
** [[note]]
** quote
** post with embedded media (photo or video), at least partially displayed by default
