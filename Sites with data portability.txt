Below is a list of sites that meet the following criteria:

# they let you publish things on the web
# they let you retrieve '''all''' the content that you have posted in a reasonably user friendly way (with third party tools, if necessary)

(Note: being able to backup your data from these services means you can transition to running your own site. [[posse]] is a better way as the canonical version remains on your site and syndicate to the other services.)
