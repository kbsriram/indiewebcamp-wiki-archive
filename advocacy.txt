'''Advocacy''' are efforts to help and empower others by sharing knowledge, ideas and solutions with them.

== Good and bad practices ==

* '''Do''' enable and empower; '''don't''' dictate and domineer.
* '''Don't''' downplay people's concerns or ignore legitimate criticisms, '''Do''' listen and ask questions, help find ways to recognize and address criticisms.
* '''Don't''' become a raving fundamentalist. The IndieWeb community is based on practicality and positive change, not becoming a weird cultish religion. Using a [[silo]] service does not make someone bad, stupid or irrational.
