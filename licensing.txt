== Open Source ==

Choosing an open source license can be challenging, but it is important to make ''some'' statement about your software's free (or non-free) status. Without a license, the implication is that others are not free to use your code. 

=== Public Domain ===

* [[User:snarfed.org]] releases many of his projects (e.g.,  [[Bridgy]]) with the simple statement "This project is placed in the public domain."
* [http://unlicense.org/ Unlicense]: simple text discliaming any copyright, and explicitlly allowing use for any purpose. More explicit and professional-sounding than the WTFPL.

=== Permissive ===

Permissive licenses generally require attribution and that the original license text be included in redistributions, but do not require that derivative works remain open source.

This category seems to be by far the most popular among IndieWebCamp participants

=== Copyleft ===

Copyleft licenses require that derivative works remain open source, and often require they retain same license. For that reason, some critics consider these licenses "viral".

* GPL: probably the best-known copyleft license. Linked software must remain GPL, and libraries used by GPL software must be licensed with GPL or GPL-compatible licenses.
* AGPL
