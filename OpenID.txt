{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID OpenID]</dfn>''' is a method of using an HTTP URL as an identity for signing into websites. OpenID has been superseded by [[web-sign-in]] / [[indieauth]].

== Setup ==
To use indieauth.com as an OpenID delegate for the OpenID identifier of your site, add the following two link tags to the HTML (inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element) of your website, replacing "aaronparecki.com" with your domain of course.

<pre>
<link rel="openid.delegate" href="http://aaronparecki.com/" />
<link rel="openid.server" href="https://indieauth.com/openid" />
</pre>
__TOC__

== IndieWeb Examples ==
Examples of IndieWeb sites which act as their own OpenID provider, without relying on delegation to another provider
* [[User:cweiske.de|cweiske.de]] on http://cweiske.de/
* ... add yourself

Examples of IndieWeb sites which consume (allow login via) OpenID in particular (beyond using IndieAuth or any silo logins like Twitter, Facebook, Google+).
* http://p.cweiske.de/
* http://indieauth.id.cweiske.de/ via [[indieauth-openid]]
* ... add yourself

== Additional Examples ==
Additional examples of sites either natively providing OpenID or consuming it, maintained by IndieWeb participants:
* [[User:cweiske.de]] uses OpenID as backend login method for several TYPO3 instances
* ...

== FAQ ==
=== Why does indieauth.com not consume OpenID? ===
Why doesn't [[indieauth.com]] support OpenID as an authentication mechanism?

IndieAuth.com used to support OpenID, but there were a lot of problems with getting really weird errors back from OpenID providers inconsistently, and there seemed to be some issue with the omniauth OpenID plugin.

IndieAuth.com can now be used as an OpenID provider (and thus delegate), however.

You can use [[indieauth-openid]] if you want to sign in to IndieAuth sites with OpenID.

== Shutdowns ==
AKA <span id="Abandonment">Abandonment</span>. The following sites used to provide or accept (consume) OpenID as an identifier to log-in but no longer do. Most recent first:
* 2014-02-01 '''myOpenID''' OpenID provider shutting down, site already doesnâ€™t load as of 2013-09-04. No public notification yet, email quoted [http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4RsEr7/ here] and [http://p.cweiske.de/54 here in full]
** 2013-07-25 http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/190442/myopenid-no-longer-supported-add-alternative-login-method-to-your-account
* 2014-01-07 '''[[Disqus]]''' OpenID consumer "no longer supports Open ID"[https://twitter.com/disqushelp/status/420628751357988864]
* 2013-10-29 '''SourceForge.net''' is [https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/site-support/5733/ considering phasing out OpenID login]
** Also removed the OpenID option from their default login (you have to know and use the "?openid" URL parameter to get it).[http://cweiske.de/tagebuch/sourceforge-openid.htm]
* 2012-08-23 Disqus help said: "OpenID is no longer supported in Disqus 2012, although it's still available with Disqus Classic"[https://twitter.com/disqushelp/status/238710464748584960]
* ...
* 2010-09-27 '''[[PBWorks]]''' dropped OpenID consuming support
** https://www.pingidentity.com/blogs/pingtalk/2010/09/Another-one-bites-the-OpenID-dust.html
* ...

== Consumption Complexity ==
Contrast easy [[Twitter]]/[[PuSH]]/[[OAuth]] APIs + examples with huge/complex OpenID PHP libraries.
* Over a dozen classes with dozens of methods total in http://openidenabled.com/php-openid/
** That's the 1.x libs (nevermind 2.x) and samples just for consuming OpenIDs. 

The barrier to entry for OpenID support is far too high for independent developers.

OpenID also has a lot of unnecessary bloat as a spec: [[wikipedia:i-name|i-names]] (XRI-based), [[wikipedia:Yadis|Yadis]] and [[wikipedia:Light-Weight Identity|LID]]. Ignoring all this cruft could create a much simpler OpenID that just uses URLs on the web, thus making it simpler to implement ("[http://tommorris.org/posts/170 ReallyOpenID]").
