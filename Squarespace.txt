Individual pages can also be read as JSON:

For example, the page at http://developers.squarespace.com can be read as JSON at http://developers.squarespace.com?format=json and at http://developers.squarespace.com/?format=json-pretty 

The JSON responses for Squarespace pages include the HTML rendered text of the body of the page, together with a limited set of metadata.
