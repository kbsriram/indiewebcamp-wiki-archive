'''<dfn>WordPress</dfn>''' is an open source blog software as well as a blog hosting service.

* '''WordPress open source software''', available at http://wordpress.org
* '''[http://wordpress.com WordPress.com]''' blog hosting service (silo)

== WordPress software ==
One of many IndieWeb [[Projects]], [http://wordpress.org WordPress] is web software you can use to create a beautiful website or blog. Estimates are that Wordpress powers 20% of sites for which the content management server is identifiable. 

If you're interested in jumping into the IndieWeb, and you've  chosen WordPress as your tool of choice, great! Here are instructions that follow the step by step, ground up approach of [[IndieMark]].

As you complete each step, try plugging your site into [http://indiewebify.me/ indiewebify.me]. It will give you instant feedback, confirming that it's working or helping you fix it if not.

<div style="clear:right">__TOC__</div>

== Getting started with Wordpress ==
We'll assume you already have your own [[personal-domain]]. After that, you'll need [[web-hosting]]. There are plenty of good options. [http://wpengine.com/ WPEngine] is one of the best for both beginners and advanced hackers. [[#WordPress.com hosting service]] is solid and easy to use, but limits you to pre-approved plugins and themes.

=== Security and Spam Protection ===

One of the most important things for new users to do is to properly secure their Wordpress installation. 

==== Usernames ====
Account names like "admin" or "administrator" are popular targets for brute-force login attempts, and should not be used as a username.

==== Default Settings ====

Disable registration of new users.

==== Login Security Plugins ====

There are many options in this area...

* [http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fail2ban/ WP Fail2Ban] logs all login attempts, whether successful or not, to the syslog of the server using LOG_AUTH. If you have server level access, you can act on these logs using Fail2Ban or other software to block IP addresses.
* [http://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/ IndieAuth for Wordpress] allows users to sign in with their domain instead of a username and password. (See more complete details below.)

==== Spam/Comment Protection ====

Some individuals may prefer to disable local commenting in favor of only allowing commenting through webmentions. If local commenting is enabled, there should be some form of protection installed.

* [http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/ Akismet] is a spam protection service by Automattic, the company that runs Wordpress.com and is thus a major contributor/sponsor of the Wordpress open source project. It is free for personal use.
* Combined together, the [http://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention webmention] and [http://wordpress.org/plugins/semantic-linkbacks semantic-linkbacks] plugins let you accept comments as [[webmention]]s from other web sites. They also let you [[backfeed]] comments, likes, etc. from social networks by using [[Bridgy]] (see further notes below).<br />'''Warning''': Don't use the pre 2.0 version [http://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/ indieweb plugin]! That is an old, outdated bundle of the webmention and semantic-linkbacks plugins together, nothing more.

== Adding Indieweb Support/Elements to a Wordpress Site ==
Here are steps to add IndieWeb support to a WordPress site.

See also individual articles bloggers have written about setting up their sites with indieweb support:
* 2014-08-30 http://techlifeweb.com/using-wordpress-for-indieweb/

=== [[IndieAuth]] ===
Once you have WordPress up and running, you'll want to set up [[IndieAuth]]. If you haven't already done so (above) install [http://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/ IndieAuth for Wordpress] which allows users to sign in with their domain instead of a username and password. Next, you'll need to add the appropriate [[rel-me]] link(s) to your homepage. The[http://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth-links/ IndieAuth-Links] plugin makes this easy, but you can also use [http://en.support.wordpress.com/add-social-media-buttons-to-your-sidebar-or-footer/ Social Media Buttons] or a [http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Widgets#Using_Text_Widgets Text Widget] to add the needed [[rel-me]] link(s). Detail can be found at [https://indieauth.com/setup indieauth.com/setup] Once you've done that, head over to [https://indieauth.com/ indieauth.com] and sign in to test that you've set things up appropriately!

* FIXME: This section conflates adding rel-me links to satisfy indieauth.com (e.g. for logging into the wiki) with the ''IndieAuth for Wordpress'' plugin that lets you authenticate on your own site with indieauth. The latter is a much more advanced step and should be moved to another section (and the distinction probably needs to be clarified) [[User:Kylewm.com|Kylewm.com]] 15:52, 12 September 2014 (PDT)

=== [[microformats]] ===
Next, you'll want to add [[microformats]] support. Try out the
[http://wordpress.org/themes/sempress SemPress theme], it's the best way to do
it. If you don't want to give up your current theme, try the
[https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-uf2 wordpress-uf2 plugin] (requires FTP).

=== [[POSSE]] ===
Along with [[personal-domain]]s, <span id="POSS">[[POSSE]]</span> is one of the cornerstones of the IndieWeb. In short, instead of posting to social network [[silos]], you post to your own site and then copy to the silos.

You can [[POSSE]] manually, but most people automate it. WordPress has many plugins that do this. A few of the most popular are:
* [http://jetpack.me/support/publicize/ Jetpack Publicize]
* [http://wordpress.org/plugins/social/ Social] (Twitter/Facebook)
* [http://www.nextscripts.com/social-networks-auto-poster-for-wordpress/ NextScripts SNAP]
* [http://wordpress.org/plugins/social/ Mailchimp Social]
* [http://ifttt.com/ IFTTT] (If This, Then That) Details about this [http://techlifeweb.com/using-wordpress-for-indieweb/#posse here].

Other plugins that can be used to POSSE:
* [https://wordpress.org/plugins/tumblr-crosspostr/ Tumblr Crosspostr] (Tumblr only)

If you POSSE, it's good practice to include [[rel-syndication]] links on your WordPress posts. Try the [http://wordpress.org/plugins/relsyndication/ rel-syndication plugin] for that(Currently only supports the Social plugin, the [https://github.com/jihaisse/wordpress-syndication GitHub mainline] has minimal support of Tumblr, Twitter and Facebook for NextScripts SNAP ).

If you also want to go the other direction and pull your social network posts and data back to WordPress, there are [[PESOS]] plugins too. To start, try [http://www.enthropia.com/labs/wp-lifestream/ Lifestream].

=== [[backfeed]] ===
Once you're POSSEing, you may want to pull comments and likes on the social network posts back to your site. This is called [[backfeed]]. Many of the POSSE plugins above can do this; see [[backfeed#WordPress_Plugins]] for details.

Another option is [[Bridgy]], a service that automatically sends [[webmention]]s for activity on your POSSEd posts inside [[silos]] (before starting to use Bridgy, make sure you first install the webmention and semantic-linkbacks plugins described below).

Which brings us to...

=== [[webmention]] ===
[[File:semantic-linkbacks.png|100px|right]]
[[Webmention]]s are also part of the core IndieWeb [[building-blocks]]. They let you send and receive replies, likes, etc. directly from your site.

Try combining the [http://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention webmention] ([http://andysylvester.com/2014/01/27/working-with-webmention-video/ video available]) and [http://wordpress.org/plugins/semantic-linkbacks semantic-linkbacks] plugins, which support [[comments]] (including the [[reply-context]]), [[likes]], [[reposts]], [[favorites]], [[RSVPs]] and classic [[mentions]].

('''Warning''': Don't use pre 2.0 version of the [http://wordpress.org/plugins/indieweb/ indieweb plugin]! It's an old, outdated bundle of the webmention and semantic-linkbacks plugins together, nothing more.)

For the webmention plugin to work, go to the Settings => Discussion page in your WordPress admin, and check the "Allow link notifications from other blogs (pingbacks and trackbacks)"
and "Allow people to post comments on new articles" checkboxes.

Also install the [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-webmention-form webmentions forms] plugin (requires FTP) to receive webmentions directly from the [http://adactio.com/journal/6469/ comments section] of your blog.

=== More building blocks ===
If you've made it this far, congrats! You're a fully functioning member of the IndieWeb! Here are a few more plugins you might want to try. Many require FTP or other more technical setup.

* [http://wordpress.org/plugins/hum/ URL Shortener: WP-Hum]
* [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-webactions WebActions]
* [https://gist.github.com/pfefferle/1724438 blavatars (icons)]
* [http://wordpress.org/plugins/indieauth/ IndieAuth]
* [https://snarfed.org/indieweb-press-this-bookmarklets-for-wordpress IndieWeb reply, repost, like, and RSVP bookmarklets]
* [https://github.com/dshanske/indieweb-taxonomy Indieweb Taxonomy] - Adds a taxonomy to the post type in Wordpress allow for posts to be classified as a reply/life/repost etc. This allows archives to be generated for these kinds of posts as well as support to add the appropriate markup. Note: People using versions prior to 0.1 will have to enable the option to migrate to new data structure.

=== Optional plugins ===
* [http://wordpress.org/plugins/browserid/ BrowserID/Persona]
* [http://wordpress.org/plugins/pubsubhubbub/ PubSubHubbub]
* [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-hashtags Hashtags]
* [https://github.com/jihaisse/custom-feed-url Custom feed URL]
* [[WhisperFollow| Whisperfollow for feed aggregation]]

=== Past or old tech plugins ===
* [http://wordpress.org/plugins/openid/ OpenID]
* [https://github.com/pfefferle/ostatus-for-wordpress OStatus]
* [https://github.com/pfefferle/salmon Salmon]

=== Themes ===
Some themes that support [[microformats]] or other semantics.

* [https://github.com/pfefferle/SemPress SemPress] supports microformats, microformats2 and schema.org (theme)
* [http://p2theme.com/ P2] is a microblog theme for WordPress that might be adaptable for indiewebsters.

Rather than a theme [https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-uf2 uf2] is a plugin that attempts to add microformats2 data to an existing theme though as the author admits it is very limited and recommends using a theme that supports microformats natively.

== People using WordPress ==

== Development ==

Several projects are actively under development for use in Wordpress. Plugins/themes considered complete enough for widespread use  will appear on this page. 

For brainstorming on development of Indieweb themes/plugins for Wordpress and discussion of common conventions to ensure interoperability, see [[WordPress/Development|WordPress Development]].

== Criticism ==
<span id="Problems">Problems</span> with and criticism of using WordPress software from an IndieWeb perspective.

=== Security Issues ===
WordPress (and often many popular plugins) frequently has security vulnerabilities that are found and exploited in a "zero day" fashion.

Mitigation:

Security vulnerabilities are found in many popular pieces of software, as their deployment makes them attractive targets. While there is currently limited options within the core of Wordpress, there are many security plugins that offer protection for Wordpress blogs.

=== Maintenance Vulnerability ===
Independents (quite tech smart and capable) who had their WordPress blog(s) hacked due to being unable to keep up with security updates / maintenance (too much of a hassle/chore/tax on their time). 
* Clay Shirky:
** https://plus.google.com/u/0/+AdeOshineye/posts/6zUWbNKbWrM
* Dan Brickley
** Dan Brickley mentioned WordPress as one of a few open source CMS installs of which at least one was [https://plus.google.com/u/0/105037104815911535953/posts/BEVAUoWCaP4 hacked and then his home page overwritten with spam link spam], forcing him to throw them all away and go with a simple static home page. He specifically mentions "must've left an update too late".
* [[User:Michaelw.net|Michael.net]]:
** WordPress seems to have a non trivial security hole every 6 months and I never have the time to tend to my WP install. The last major problem resulted in my blog being infested with malware and my site blacklisted by google.  WordPress is like Windows.  It's probably not really less secure than the alternatives but its popularity is such that it makes an attractive target.  Most WordPress blogs are configured to ping an [http://codex.wordpress.org/Update_Services update service] so hackers have no trouble finding targets.  Any IndieWeb solution needs to think about automatic updates and defense in depth security. -- [[User:Michaelw.net|Michael.net]]
* ...

Mitigation:

However, since Version 3.7, Wordpress supports [http://codex.wordpress.org/Configuring_Automatic_Background_Updates|automatic background updates] to alleviate this issue. By default, automatic updates for minor releases and translations are enabled. There are configurable settings to allow major release updates, and updates for specific plugins. 

The Core Automatic Update functionality can also be used to push critical security updates to popular plugins. This was used in April of 2014 when the popular JetPack plugin was discovered to have a critical vulnerability and the developers requested the security update be pushed via the system to all users who had not expressly disabled all updates. 

=== Fatal Error memory exhausted ===
WordPress seems to run out of memory on servers sometimes, and give a message like:

* e.g. on http://yottabytes.info/?p=10497 (on 2014-06-08 15:28 EDT): <blockquote> Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 41943040 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 32 bytes) in /home/johnkrol/public_html/wp-includes/post.php on line 1961</blockquote>

=== Pages can not have numeric slugs ===
WordPress does not allow numeric page slugs, making it difficult to set up pages representing a year, such as <code>/event/2014/</code>. This is frustrating if you need to set up a series of annually recurring pages (not blog posts) without using a plugin. [https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/11917]

== Switching away from ==
There has been a trend of folks switching away from WordPress for various reasons (e.g. problems noted above).  They seem to switch to one of three options, one indieweb, and two silo.

* static site generator or some other IndieWeb [[project]]
* silo: WordPress.com hosting service (see below)
* other silo: e.g. [[Tumblr]] (others?)

=== Switched to another project ===
(stub)

There are many folks with personal sites that have kept their personal site and webhost, but switched away from WordPress to another solution, e.g. typically a static site generator:
* 2013-11-10 Julie Pagano to [[Middleman]] (http://middlemanapp.com/) : http://juliepagano.com/blog/2013/11/10/site-redesign-using-middleman/
Many others have switched to Jekyll or are in the process of doing so, e.g.:
* Crystal Beasley - per recent (2013-11) conversation on IRC
* others beforehand ...

And a few have switched to their own IndieWeb project, e.g.
* [[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] switched from WordPress for his blog to using [[p3k]] to post [[articles]] on Aaronparecki.com

=== Switched to WordPress service ===
(stub)

I know there's folks that have done this but have trouble recalling offhand who in particular.
=== Switched to Tumblr ===
(stub)

Folks that were on WordPress that have moved to Tumblr
* Micki Krimmel
* ...

== POSSE to WordPress ==
With WordPress's API it's possible to automatically <span id="POSSE">[[POSSE]]</span> posts to it, and there's at least one example of an indieweb community member doing so to the hosted service: [[WordPress#POSSE_to_hosted|POSSE to hosted]]

=== Tantek reply POSSE ===
{{t}} has started experimenting with manually POSSEing reply posts to WordPress blogs to their comment sections. E.g.:
* original reply: http://tantek.com/2014/255/t2/well-deserved-talented-known-minor-correction
* manual POSSE comment: https://gigaom.com/2014/09/11/indieweb-advocates-launch-known-so-bloggers-can-be-social-and-still-control-their-content/#comment-1483187
** related: [[Bridgy]] Publish feature request to [https://github.com/snarfed/bridgy/issues/271 Publish to Wordpress comments] which could help automate this!
* semi-automatic POSSE tweet @-reply: https://twitter.com/t/status/510633038062309376
** only *semi* automatic because I had to dig up the in-reply-to tweet permalink manually, but then the [[POSSE]] copy of my reply and tweet threading was handled automatically by [[Falcon]].

== WordPress.com hosting service ==
WordPress.com is a blog hosting service with impressive importing and export features. See for details:
* http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/26/wordpress-com-has-imported-15m-posts-in-the-last-30-days-remains-a-top-safe-haven-for-nomad-bloggers/

=== Hosted themes ===
WordPress.com provides themes to change the HTML/CSS/JS and general appearance of a user's site. While users can pay for a feature to write custom CSS, they can't change their theme markup. Which means amongst other things, a user cannot specify some markup in a post to show on a permanlink page and not in the post when it's a part of a feed. For example,

* https://veganstraightedge.wordpress.com/2010/11/7/no-more-sharecropping
* "Originally published at: http://sbb.me/b48f1"

If you could detect "in the feed vs permalink page", you could use <code>rel="canonical"</code> on the attribution link '''from''' the syndicated copy on wordpress.com back '''to''' the original on iamshane.com. But because rel-canonical is page scoped, you shouldn't use it on a link in a post when that post is a part of the feed. To work around this, you can use <code>class="u-url u-uid"</code> on the attribution link.

=== POSSE to hosted ===
It is possible to manually [[POSSE]] [[articles]] to Wordpress.com.
==== IndieWeb POSSE Examples ====
===== Shane Becker =====
Shane Becker is manually POSSEing his articles to Wordpress.com.
* http://iamshane.com/articles/2010/11/7/1/no-more-sharecropping
** POSSE copy: https://veganstraightedge.wordpress.com/2010/11/7/no-more-sharecropping

=== webmention ===
WordPress.com doesn't have built in support for [[webmention]]s, but [[Bridgy]] can send, receive, and display webmentions for WordPress.com blogs. You can also receive webmentions with [[webmention.io]] and maybe [https://webmention.herokuapp.com/ webmention.herokuapp.com].

=== cURL Problem ===
On 2014-05-06 it was [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-05-06/line/1399412640 reported] that http://indiewebify.me returned an empty result when attempting to check gabrielscheer.com. That domain is hosted on wordpress.com and it appears that wordpress.com is blocking some cURL requests based on the User-Agent. At a minimum, it appears that wordpress.com is blocking cURL requests with the Guzzle User-Agent.

This issue was previously reported on Github on 2013-05-19 [https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle/issues/325]

==== Examples ====

* curl -i -H 'User-agent: Guzzle' http://gabrielscheer.com/ -- fails
* curl -i -H 'User-agent: indiewebify.me' http://gabrielscheer.com/ -- works
* curl -i -H 'User-agent: curl' http://gabrielscheer.com/ -- works
