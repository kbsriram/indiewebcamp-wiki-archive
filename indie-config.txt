'''<dfn>indie-config</dfn>''' is a method of using protocol handlers and postmessage to setup your indie website to both notify the browser that it can handle [[webactions]] and then do so.

indie-config was introduced and discussed at [[2014/UK|IndieWebCampUK 2014]]

== Why ==
By setting up indie-config on your personal site, you can then click on [[web action]] links or buttons on others sites (e.g. "Reply", "Favorite" etc.) and have those actions automatically activate <em>your</em> site's [[posting interface]] to.

== How ==
How to setup indie-config on your personal site:

=== Create the configuration page ===
Create a page on your site that only you will need to access. This might be a page such as "config.html". This page should contain the following [[Javascript]]:

<pre>
<script>
(function() {
  if (window.parent !== window) {
    window.parent.postMessage(JSON.stringify({
      // The endpoint you use to write replies
      reply: 'https://aaronparecki.com/note.php?reply_to={url}'
    }), '*');
  }
}());
</script>
</pre>

Replace the URL above with the URL to your own posting interface.


=== Register the web action protocol ===
On your home page, find somewhere to add this code to be displayed only to you when you are signed in to your own site.

<pre>
<script>
window.navigator.registerProtocolHandler('web+action', 'https://aaronparecki.com/config.html?handler=%s', 'Aaron Parecki');
</script>
</pre>

Note that you will want to replace the URLs (<code>https://aaronparecki.com/config.html</code>) and my name (<code>'Aaron Parecki'</code>) with your own information. You should replace the URL with the page you made in the previous step. The text you add as the third parameter will be shown in the browser prompt, so it makes sense to use your name or possibly the name of your site's software.


=== Turn it on ===
Now when you visit your home page, you will see a prompt asking whether your site should be allowed to handle "web+action://" links.

Click "Add Application" (or the equivalent for your browser) and your website is now registered in your browser or operating system.

== How to load someones indie-config ==

An example callback-based indie-config loader with timeout-handler:

<pre>
// Called like loadIndieConfig(function (config) { ... })
var loadIndieConfig = (function () {
  var config, configFrame, configTimeout,
    callbacks = [],
    handleConfig, parseConfig;

  // When the configuration has been loaded – deregister all loading mechanics and call all callbacks
  handleConfig = function () {
    config = config || {};

    configFrame.parentNode.removeChild(configFrame);
    configFrame = undefined;

    window.removeEventListener('message', parseConfig);

    clearTimeout(configTimeout);

    while (callbacks[0]) {
      callbacks.shift()(config);
    }
  };

  // When we receive a message, check if the source is right and try to parse it
  parseConfig = function (message) {
    var correctSource = (configFrame && message.source === configFrame.contentWindow);

    if (correctSource && config === undefined) {
      try {
        config = JSON.parse(message.data);
      } catch (ignore) {}

      handleConfig();
    }
  };

  return function (callback) {
    // If the config is already loaded, call callback right away
    if (config) {
      callback(config);
      return;
    }

    // Otherwise add the callback to the queue
    callbacks.push(callback);

    // Are we already trying to load the Indie-Config, then wait
    if (configFrame) {
      return;
    }

    // Create the iframe that will load the Indie-Config
    configFrame = document.createElement('iframe');
    configFrame.src = 'web+action:load';
    document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].appendChild(configFrame);
    configFrame.style.display = 'none';

    // Listen for messages so we will catch the Indie-Config message
    window.addEventListener('message', parseConfig);

    // And if no such Indie-Config message has been loaded in a while, abort the loading
    configTimeout = setTimeout(handleConfig, 3000);
  };
}());
</pre>

== FAQ ==
=== Ok to registerProtocol handler every time ===
Q: Is it ok to run that register protocol thing every time I load my home page?

A: Yes it is ok.  If you run the registerProtocolHandler() on the same page that's already registered nothing will happen – it will know that everything is registered as it should.

=== Using custom handler for replies instead of configuration ===
Q: Why does the custom handler send back configuration information instead of just handling replies directly? (i.e., web+action://permalink would be handled by with <nowiki>http://example.com/reply?u=permalink</nowiki>)

A: This does not provide a fallback if there is no handler registered. There would be a &lt;a href="web+action://permalink">Reply&lt;/a> link on the page that would go nowhere

=== isProtocolHandlerRegistered ===
Q: Couldn't you use isProtocolHandlerRegistered to check if a handler is registered, and only use the custom protocol if it is?

A: That function [https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=440620 doesn't exist!] And it would be a potential privacy leak, e.g., allowing sites to see which apps you have installed on your phone by checking facebook:, twitter:, etc..

== IndieWeb Examples ==

=== [[User:Voxpelli.com|Pelle Wessman]] ===

Pelle publishes JavaScript on http://voxpelli.com that queries a user's registered web+action handler the first time an indie-action is clicked. If an appropriate action handler is found, his "Reply" and "Post" links will use it instead of the default.

<strike>Uses the [http://x-tags.org/ X-Tags] library to configure &lt;indie-action> tags through the use of a simple [https://github.com/voxpelli/indie-action-component proof-of-concept web component].</strike>

=== [[User:waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] ===

Collaborated with Pelle at [[2014/UK|IndieWebCamp UK 2014]] where they demonstrated links on voxpelli.com directing to a reply link on waterpigs.co.uk. Barnaby has a static page on his site for registering a web+action handler: https://waterpigs.co.uk/indie-config.html

=== [[User:kylewm.com|Kyle Mahan]] ===

Registers indie-config handlers for reply, repost, favorite, and like actions using https://kylewm.com/test/indieconfig.html.

Began adapting [[#How_to_load_someones_indie-config]] to work on my site (heavily referencing the implementation on voxpelli.com). I stalled out when I could not figure out how to detect/handle the situation where no web+action handler is configured. The code so far is here https://gist.github.com/kylewm/9d97c456011868532271

== Brainstorming ==

=== Return Route ===
It would be nice to have an extra argument for a URL to return to after the action has been completed. This way we can complete everything in one window. No pop-up required.
