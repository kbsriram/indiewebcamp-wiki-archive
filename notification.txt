{{stub}}

'''<dfn>notifications</dfn>''' in the context of the IndieWeb refer to all forms and ways that an independent web site can receive a message indicating something of interest (server notifications), and potentially relay that information (preferably in realtime) to one or more devices used by the owner of that site (client notifications).

== Use Cases ==
There are numerous use cases for notifications, this is meant to capture a few that are currently real world and pervasive.

=== Individual ===
* text messages from contacts - your site receives [[indie-messaging]] from another site
* calendar reminders - your site noticing your upcoming [[event]]s and [[RSVP]]s and sending you an event reminder with details inline and URL for more info / comment / option to change RSVP.
* alarms
* social web notifications - every kind of [[webmention]] you could receive
** [[follow]] - someone has started [[follow]]ing your [[homepage]] and sent a [[webmention]] accordingly
** [[like]] - someone liked or [[favorite]]d one of your [[posts]] or homepage
** [[comment]] - someone commented on one of your posts
** [[repost]] - someone reposted one of your posts
** [[mention]] - someone wrote a post that mentioned you (via linking to your homepage, perhaps even marked it up as an h-card)
** follow-up comment - someone commented on something you commented on, or liked.
** [[person-tag]] - someone person-tagged you in a [[post]], especially a [[photo]]

=== Public-like ===
* Amber Alert text messages
* Weather alerts per http://www.nws.noaa.gov/com/weatherreadynation/wea.html
* Sports scores (realtime, e.g. World Cup goals)

== Server Notifications ==
For server notifications, we use [[webmention]]

== Client Notifications ==
Also/often referred to as "push notifications".

For notifications from an indieweb site to a web browser on a device, you may be able to use one or more of the following:
* http://www.w3.org/TR/notifications/
* https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/SimplePush
** Works on FirefoxOS devices and (presumably) the [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Using_the_B2G_desktop_client desktop simulator]

== Beware of ==
Real world problems occurring in notification systems elsewhere:
=== Too Many Notifications ===
Receiving too many notifications makes them not want to use a client:

* E.g.: 2014-10-03 https://twitter.com/freebsdgirl/status/518146125036290048 <blockquote>Once again, not checking notifications. Using web, not client. Too many notifications. Will check later.</blockquote>

AKA alarm fatigue:

=== Anxiety And Fear ===
[[mobile]] notifications can cause anxiety and fear:

I get this '''strange gut feeling'''. It's not like my phone has turned evil and is trying to take over the world, it is simply telling me that I have a [[text]], [[email]], BBM, [[facebook]] notification....(could be anything really, Blackberries really can do everything)</blockquote> '''Emphasis''' and Wikilinks added.

== Projects ==
=== Mention app ===
{{main|mention-app}}
* Aaronpk is working on an iOS app (for now called just [[mention-app]]) to send him push notifications from an [[h-feed]]. Thus, if a server publishes received [[webmentions]] into an h-feed page, the app will get those (hopefully via [[PuSH]], last resort via polling), and propagate them to the user's iOS device.
