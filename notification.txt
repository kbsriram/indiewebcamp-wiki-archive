'''<dfn>notifications</dfn>''' in the context of the IndieWeb refer to all forms and ways that an independent web site can receive a message indicating something of interest (server notifications), and potentially relay that information (preferably in realtime) to one or more devices used by the owner of that site (client notifications).

== Use Cases ==
There are numerous use cases for notifications, this is meant to capture a few that are currently real world and pervasive.

=== Individual ===
* text messages from contacts - your site receives [[indie-messaging]] from another site
* calendar reminders - your site noticing your upcoming [[event]]s and [[RSVP]]s and sending you an event reminder with details inline and URL for more info / comment / option to change RSVP.
* alarms
* social web notifications - every kind of [[webmention]] you could receive
** [[follow]] - someone has started [[follow]]ing your [[homepage]] and sent a [[webmention]] accordingly
** [[like]] - someone liked or [[favorite]]d one of your [[posts]] or homepage
** [[comment]] - someone commented on one of your posts
** [[repost]] - someone reposted one of your posts
** [[mention]] - someone wrote a post that mentioned you (via linking to your homepage, perhaps even marked it up as an h-card)
** follow-up comment - someone commented on something you commented on, or liked.
** [[person-tag]] - someone person-tagged you in a [[post]], especially a [[photo]]

=== Public-like ===
* Amber Alert text messages
* Weather alerts per http://www.nws.noaa.gov/com/weatherreadynation/wea.html
* Sports scores (realtime, e.g. World Cup goals)

== Server Notifications ==
For server notifications, we use [[webmention]]

== Client Notifications ==
Also/often referred to as "push notifications".

For notifications from an indieweb site to a web browser on a device, you may be able to use one or more of the following:
* http://www.w3.org/TR/notifications/
* https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI/SimplePush
** Works on FirefoxOS devices and (presumably) the [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Using_the_B2G_desktop_client desktop simulator]

== Beware of ==
Real world problems occurring in notification systems elsewhere:
=== Too Many Notifications ===
Receiving too many notifications makes them not want to use a client:

* E.g.: 2014-10-03 https://twitter.com/freebsdgirl/status/518146125036290048 <blockquote>Once again, not checking notifications. Using web, not client. Too many notifications. Will check later.</blockquote>

AKA alarm fatigue:

=== Anxiety And Fear ===
[[mobile]] notifications can cause anxiety and fear:
* 2011-08-26 <cite>[http://thedailyadventuresofhannah.blogspot.co.uk/2011/08/blackberry-red-light-of-doom.html Blackberry Red Light of Doom]</cite> <blockquote>Basically, whenever I see the red light flash on my Blackberry, I do '''panic''' a little bit inside and I dont know why! I get this '''strange gut feeling'''. It's not like my phone has turned evil and is trying to take over the world, it is simply telling me that I have a [[text]], [[email]], BBM, [[facebook]] notification....(could be anything really, Blackberries really can do everything)</blockquote> '''Emphasis''' and Wikilinks added.

=== Distraction ===
When attempting to focus one's attention on specific projects or goals, being deluged with unrelated notifications can be very distracting. Every notification system needs facilities to get specific notifications to be quiet, temporarily or permanently. The lack of said modes may reflect a software vendor's desire for you to engage more with their service rather than respecting your time and resources.

== Projects ==
=== Mention app ===
{{main|mention-app}}
* Aaronpk is working on an iOS app (for now called just [[mention-app]]) to send him push notifications from an [[h-feed]]. Thus, if a server publishes received [[webmentions]] into an h-feed page, the app will get those (hopefully via [[PuSH]], last resort via polling), and propagate them to the user's iOS device.

== Platform Examples ==
Examples of notification user interface presentation from [[platforms]] (e.g. operating systems)

=== iOS 7 ===
This iOS 7 "recent items" notifications example shows 2-3 different kinds of notifications from two apps, a [[favorite]], several [[likes]], and a [[reply]].

=== <img src="https://twitter.com/instagram/profile_image" style="max-height:1.5em"/> [[Instagram]] ===
<blockquote style="width:20em">'''Instagram''' 8m ago <br/>cristyle__ liked your photo.<br/><br/><hr/><br/>...<br/><br/><hr/><br/>lucianteo said: "You're burping <br/>hashtags."<br/><br/><hr/></blockquote>

=== Analysis of design differences ===
Note the differences:
* "@username" vs. "username"
* "[[favorited]]:" vs. "[[liked]]" (no colon) vs. "said:"
* (linebreak) (unquoted 99 chars of tweet ...) vs. "your photo." vs. (inline quoted reply)

Some presentations of some notifications like these "recent items" begin to look like "[[cards]]".
