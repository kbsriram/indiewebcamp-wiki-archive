An '''<dfn>event</dfn>''' is a type of [[post]] that in addition to a post name (event title) has a start datetime (likely end datetime), and a location.

''For information on IndieWebCamp [[events]] themselves, see:''
* [[events]]

== Marking up ==
Event posts must be marked up with [[h-event]].

Optionally they can be wrapped in an [[h-entry]] as well (though it's not clear this is necessary). ''Parsers should be prepared to handle events without an h-entry tag.''

== Accepting RSVPs ==
A site publishing event posts '''should''' accept [[rsvp]] [[webmentions]] and update the event's attendance information accordingly.

See: http://microformats.org/wiki/rsvp

== Accepting Invitations ==
A site publishing event posts '''should''' accept [[invitation]] [[webmentions]] and update the event's "invited" information accordingly.

In implementation order:
=== Ben Werdmuller ===
[[User:Werd.io|Ben Werdmuller]] uses [[idno]] on werd.io to post events since [http://werd.io/event/51c94deebed7de5c2386a1b4/unofficial-portland-post-indiewebcamp-meetup 2013-06-25] (right after IndieWebCamp [[2013]]!), which automatically accept RSVPs from other sites using [[RSVP]] webmentions. Events may also be [[comments|replied]] to in the same manner as notes and articles. E.g.
* index page of upcoming/recent events: http://werd.io/content/events
* http://werd.io/event/51c94deebed7de5c2386a1b4/unofficial-portland-post-indiewebcamp-meetup
* http://werd.io/2013/an-indieweb-catchup-over-food-and-drink (with example of explicit visible [[event#Invitations|invitations]])

=== Aaron Parecki ===
[[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] uses [[p3k]] on aaronparecki.com to post events since [http://aaronparecki.com/events/2013/07/09/1/speed-geeking-an-intro-to-oauth2 2013-07-08], which automatically accept RSVPs from other sites using [[RSVP]] webmentions. E.g.

=== Bret Comnes ===
[[User:Bret.io|Bret Comnes]] has implemented events inside of [[jekyll]] for bret.io since [http://bret.io/2013/07/25/t1/ 2013-07-25]. It supports receiving webmentions, but does not parse responses for RSVP status or display reply contexts at the moment. Example:
*  http://bret.io/2013/07/25/t1/
*  (bad) Example of data https://raw.github.com/bcomnes/bcomnes.github.io/master/_posts/notes/2013-07-25-t1.md
The event data is stored in the YAML which separates the final layout and the event data.  A form is used to assist in creating the event post via [[prose.io]].

== Design Brainstorming ==
As ideas here are implemented, they should be moved to actual sections of their own with links to examples.

=== Image header ===
Typical [[silos]] event posts (e.g. [[Facebook]], [[Google+]]) provide (encourage) the option of an event image - used as a header for the event. This header is used at the top of the event permalink page, and also often shown in an event list view (e.g. on [[Facebook]]).

Such header images are often quite a good visual/emotional draw for the event. Header images are typically representative of the event, sometimes displayed with the name of the event superimposed on top.

If you're posting events, consider providing this option for yourself (in your event posting UI or otherwise as part of your publishing system) as part of your indieweb event posts as well.

Since the photo would be deliberately chosen and associated with the event, we could extend [[h-event]] to represent the photo as well with:
* <code>u-photo</code> (re-used from [[h-card]]).

'''Screenshots needed'''

=== Map image ===
Some [[silos]] event posts (e.g. [[Facebook]], [[Plancast]]) automatically generate a horizontal rectangle map view of the event location.

In particular, on event posts, the location is shown *first* as a centered dot in a wide and short rectangle map that shows the local area, and then second underneath as text address.

Showing a map and showing it early is both visually striking and instantly provides a sense of "is this near me", or "is this near somewhere I'd like to be or might be anyway". It quickly gives you context in a way that a purely textual address does not.

'''Screenshots needed'''

A horizontal map (banner map?) from a Facebook event:

[[File:event-map-horizontal.jpg]]

=== Attendees ===
Every event silo by default shows who else is going, and more so, often show first who else <em>you know</em> that's going to the event. Quickly seeing "who else is going" or might go or is invited is a huge sense of context/comfort as well, especially with little face icons.

E.g. Facebook clusters (potential) attendees by:
* Going
* Maybe
* Invited
(and declined is typically hidden)

'''Screenshots needed'''

Event attendees on Facebook:

[[File:event-attendees-facebook.png]]

Note the going/maybe/invited sections on FB first show *only* those you know (if any), and *only if* there's no one you know in a section, does the section show 5 icons of others who said they're going/maybe or were invited. In either case, the order of icons is most recently responded/invited first.

Public events don't necessarily have a public list of invited users, depending on the system, but nonetheless list attendees. For example, on Plancast:

[[File:public-event-plancast.jpg|300px]]

Plancast only shows invitees on an event to the event organizer, i.e. when the event organizer themselves is looking at the event permalink page.

=== Invitations ===
{{main|invitation}}
People like being explicitly invited to events. One way to send invitations with indieweb events is:
* Add people explicitly to an invited list on the event (present on the event page as noted above in Attendees) - with icon and name linked to their home page.
* Send [[webmentions]] to their home page from the event permalink.
The idea is that a person's site's webmentions queue sees webmentions from the event to the home page and interprets that as an invitation to the event. If needed we could add some markup like <code>rel="invitee"</code> or <code>class="u-invitee"</code> or <code>class="p-invitee h-card"</code> to the event page so that consuming applications could tell the difference between mentions and invitations of people.

Also see [[indieweb messaging]], which also uses a webmention to the user's homepage.

=== POSSE ===
How and where should event posts be [[POSSE]]d?

Event-aware destinations to consider:
* [[Eventbrite]] - has best API for creating events, getting updates, perhaps backfeeding attendees etc.
* [[Facebook]] - likely has broadest reach of people you might want to explicitly invite
** creating an event on your site, then a (even manual) POSSE copy on FB, then seeing people's RSVPs on FB show up on the event *on your site* is possible via a [[Bridgy]]. E.g.
** [[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaron Parecki]] is posting events using [[p3k]] on aaronparecki.com and manually POSSEing them to Facebook:
*** original: http://aaronparecki.com/events/2014/01/29/1/homebrew-website-club
*** POSSE copy: https://www.facebook.com/events/1453049941575679
** [[User:Werd.io|Ben Werdm√ºller]] is posting events using [[idno]] on werd.io and manually POSSEing them to Facebook: 
*** original: http://werd.io/2014/homebrew-website-club
*** POSSE copy: https://www.facebook.com/events/200590280142030/
* [[Plancast]] - event-specific silo

Problematic event-aware destinations:
* [[Google+]] - another [[silo]] that has explicit event posts, but has some challenges:
** G+ API doesn't expose events
*** when someone shares an event, you can see it in their stream with activities.list and get, but that's just a note about it, not the event itself. 
*** G+ API bug asking for events: http://code.google.com/p/google-plus-platform/issues/detail?id=567

Other destinations:
* [[Twitter]] - can we compress the details of an event post into 140 characters or less? (117 to leave room for event permalink URL, 116 for https).
** How do we abbreviate what/when/where "fields"? E.g. 
*** What: summary... (ellipsed)
*** Where: @-alias of venue (how do we do venue lookup on Twitter? Perhaps use [[Foursquare]] to lookup the venue and see if their venue entry has a Twitter for the venue?
*** When: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM (seems quite long, what's the best way to compress a datetime in a human readable way?)
*** CC: @-names (of folks to explicitly notify, like an invitation)
** Should such fields be explicitly labeled e.g. with "What: / Where:" etc. with linebreaks between them?
** Or should we figure out a plain text event serialization format since things like an @-named venue already reads well "at venue"? (see [http://microformats.org/wiki/picoformats picoformats] for prior work/research on this)

=== Events index ===
Indieweb sites with event posts (and perhaps even just [[RSVP]] posts) could also provide an index of what events they're attending, e.g.
* at a /events URL

From a human [[design]] perspective this makes sense as:
* "these are the events I'll be at" 
which is likely a union of personal event posts and RSVP yes (and maybe maybes too?) posts.

Kind of like a view of your public calendar of events, regardless of whether you're organizing/hosting or just attending.

Such an events index could be displayed as a list view (similar to the default view of fb.com/events) or as a calendar view (like gCal), or with an option to toggle between them.

An easily-discoverable link should probably be displayed from the user's index or homepage.
* Potential for microformats or microformats-like markup to indicate a user's calendar as linked from their h-card?

== Silo Examples ==
=== Facebook ===
[[Facebook]] has had one of the more interesting/nicer/cleaner event page designs for quite some time.

Here is a screenshot of the [[events/2014-02-12-homebrew-website-club|2014-02-12 Homebrew Website Club]] event (for the SF location) on Facebook, manually POSSEd by [[User:Werd.io|Ben Werdmuller]] from http://werd.io/2014/homebrew-website-club-meeting :

==== Redesign 2014-02-27 ====
Here is what the 2014-02-27 redesign (limited rollout as of that date) looks like:

Shall we count the design regressions?

# Global noise in the left column replaces the very relevant and easily skimmable who is going, maybe, invited lists of people
# Big blank area where there is no event header image
# Lots of visual noise from the gray background between the white blocks of text
# Missing the map overview graphic
# Less clear who is going/maybe/invited
# Lack of hierarchy (ordering) of going/maybe/invited removes subtle invitee incentive to upgrade from invited to maybe to going.
# ... more?
