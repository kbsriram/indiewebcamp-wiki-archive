{{stub}}

'''<dfn>[http://linkedin.com/ LinkedIn]</dfn>''' is a special-purpose [[silo]] for hosting your professional resume / history.

== Issues ==
=== Lack of rel-me ===
LinkedIn has a way to add your "Blog" URL to your LinkedIn profile, however, it has multiple problems:
* your LinkedIn profile URL does not actually have curlable hyperlink markup to your blog (JSON only)
* hyperlink itself uses a linkedin redirect to your blog
* hyperlink in the DOM lacks a rel=me

So LinkedIn will not work as an [[IndieAuth]] provider.
