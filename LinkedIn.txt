'''<dfn>[http://linkedin.com/ LinkedIn]</dfn>''' is a special-purpose [[silo]] for hosting your professional resume / history.

== Issues ==
=== Lack of rel-me ===
LinkedIn has a way to add your "Blog" URL to your LinkedIn profile, however, it has multiple problems:
* your LinkedIn profile URL does not actually have curlable hyperlink markup to your blog (JSON only)
* hyperlink itself uses a linkedin redirect to your blog
* hyperlink in the DOM lacks a rel=me

So LinkedIn will not work as an [[IndieAuth]] provider.

=== Creepy emails ===
In order to retain users, LinkedIn now send out emails to tell you that people are looking at your profile, which is kind of creepy. The subject lines are of the form: "(name), people are looking at your LinkedIn profile".

It doesn't quite reach dark pattern levels of evil, but it is playing on your natural anxiety around being watched (especially in an era of PRISM and Edward Snowden etc.)
