<dfn>[http://movabletype.com Movable Type]</dfn> is commercial blogging software written in Perl and original released in 2001.

Many, very active 10+ year old blogs use Movable Type, e.g.,

* http://dashes.com/anil/
* http://daringfireball.net/
* http://waxy.org/
* http://codinghorror.com - 2004[http://blog.codinghorror.com/coding-horror-movable-type-since-2004/] - 2014[http://blog.codinghorror.com/10-years-of-coding-horror/]

This makes it an interesting case study for [[longevity]]. 

<blockquote>Movable type is interesting in the database debate. It uses a database, but renders all pages to static files by default. So sites made with it tend to be less fragile and persist longer</blockquote>
