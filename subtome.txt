SubToMe (Subscribe To Me, [http://subtome.com website]) is a button content publishers can put on their sites which enables users to subscribe to their feed in whatever reader they choose â€” sort of a universal follow button.

Indieweb Creators currently using SubToMe buttons on their personal sites:

== Demo ==

SubToMe can be tried as a subscriber out on the project homepage: [http://subtome.com SubToMe].
Many feed readers already implement it, but you can also pick your favorite subscription tool on the [https://www.subtome.com/store.html SubToMe store].

== Why ==

If my personal site has a Twitter button and RSS feed, it's orders of magnitude easier to follow me on twitter than to add my feed to a reader or any kind.

SubToMe aims at making both things as easy, while still making sure the open-ness of RSS stays.

It does that by storing the subscriber's preferred subscriptions in his browser's localStorage, so that it does not promote service X or Y who may disappear while still making things as easy to use for the subscriber.

[https://www.subtome.com/publishers.html Adding a button] to your site is quite easy and can be fully customized. 

For those who worry that SubToMe maybe yet another service to depend on, know that it's just a "domain" used to obtain 'namespace' in the subscriber's browser when storing his preferred subscription tool. SubToMe is only static (HTML + JS + CSS) and can actually be served from any HTTP server. The only constraint is the use of https for security purposes. The code is available [https://github.com/superfeedr/subtome on github].
