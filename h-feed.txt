'''<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/h-feed h-feed]</dfn>''' is a [[microformats2]] experiment with a top level feed object to contain [[h-entry]] [[posts]]. It is functionally a [[DRY]]er replacement for RSS/Atom [[feed files]] and thus could supersede them.

== How ==
Mark up your 
* index page with class="h-feed" (e.g. on the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>)
* its top level <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> with class="p-name"
** if it links to the index (itself) then class="u-url" on that hyperlink
** otherwise if you lack any top level links, this works: <code><nowiki><a class="u-url" href="/"></a></nowiki></code>
* markup the [[h-card]] you already have on your index page with class="p-author"
* and add class="u-photo" on the representative photo of your index page (e.g. banner etc.), or leave it out and let consumers imply/use the u-photo of the p-author h-card you marked up in the previous step

== Why ==
So indie [[readers]] who subscribe to your site can display:
* a name (and icon) for your site/feed in a list
* [[authorship]] of the feed
* multiple feeds from a page (less common)

== IndieWeb Examples ==
IndieWeb community members that support h-feed:

=== Tantek ===
[[User:Tantek|Tantek Ã‡elik]] supports h-feed on his [http://tantek.com/ tantek.com] home page using an index.html template and [[Falcon]] since [http://tantek.com/2012/198/t1/added-microformats2-h-feed-h-entry 2012-07-16], at [[User:Sandeep.io|Sandeep Shetty]]'s encouragement, to help with the indie [[reader]] he is building.

=== Barnaby Walters ===

=== Jeena ===
[[User:Jeena.net|Jeena]] supports h-feed for his blog posts and notes on https://jeena.net since 2014-02-25

=== Tom Morris ===

==Brainstorming==

=== partial feeds===
Partial (e.g. truncated) vs full h-feeds.

A lot of blogs have feeds with partial content, where the entries only have post names/titles, permalinks, and sometimes summaries but not full post content. This could be done for UX reasons where the reader is not subjected to a full long post but a quick list of shorter summaries.

If you do have a partial feed (e.g. on your home page), it is good (for indie [[reader]] consumption) to also have a separate full feed page.

The partial feed can use a <code>u-uid u-url</code> to link to the full feed page which could be discovered by a canonical h-feed discovery algorithm.
<pre>
    <div class="h-feed" id="partial_feed">
        <h1 class="p-name">
         <a class="u-url" href="#partial_feed">Partial Feed</a></h1>
        <a class="u-uid u-url" href="/feed.html">Full Feed</a>
        <ol>
            <li class="h-entry"><a href="permalink1">Article1 name</a></li>
            <li class="h-entry"><a href="permalink2">Article2 name</a></li>
        </ol>
    </div>
</pre>

==== design freedom ====
The possibility of separate partial vs full feeds provides more design freedom for content publishers, since they can choose to have a full or partial (or no!) feed on their homepage and thus design accordingly.

<blockquote>acegiak: KartikPrabhu: my wife's site (which I'm helping her add microformats etc to) is a potential test for this because she's an artist and wants her landing page to be quite specific in appearance.</blockquote>

=== canonical feed autodiscovery ===
==== prior work ====
Feed readers discover the links to legacy RSS/Atom feed files automatically from HTML pages by parsing for links with <code>rel="alternate"</code> and  <code>type="application/rss+xml"</code> or <code>type="application/atom+xml"</code> respectively. 

When such links use the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of the page, this provides the potential for a nice UX where the user does not need to know about the 'plumbing' of feeds / feed files. 

Example from [http://adactio.com adactio.com] in [http://feedly.com Feedly]

[[File:autodiscovery-feed-example-adactio.jpg|500px|thumb|center|autodiscovery feed example from adactio.com]]

How can (possibly multiple) h-feed feeds be discovered similarly?

==== rel feed ====
Link to h-feed marked-up html pages from the home page using <code>rel="feed"</code> with <code>type="text/html"</code> and an optional <code>title=""Feed Title"</code>. Also, suggested to have <code>rel="feed alternate"</code>.

==== url uid ====
Alternatively, if an h-feed has a u-url u-uid property that is not the URL of the current page itself, then that u-url u-uid URL can be treated as the canonical full feed.
