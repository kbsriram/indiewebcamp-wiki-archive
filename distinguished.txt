While the IndieWeb shares many of its principles with other efforts/communities, yet there are some key aspects that '''<dfn>distinguish</dfn>''' the IndieWeb from previous efforts.

* '''[[Principles]] over project-centrism.''' There are many similar efforts that are based on a single (often open source) project. We believe a community developing a plurality of [[projects]] following a set of [[principles]] is more robust and produces better results than any such [[monoculture]].
* '''[[Selfdogfood]].''' The best way to figure out what's most important, and actually build it, is to scratch your own itch, by [[creating]] for and on your personal domain, and iterating.
* '''[[Design]] and UX first, formats/protocols second.''' We focus on UX first, and then as we figure that out we re-use/subset/implement/iterate/develop the absolutely simplest most minimal formats &amp; protocols necessary to support that UX.
