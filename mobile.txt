'''<dfn>mobile</dfn>''', in the context of the indieweb could refer to several related things:
* '''mobile friendly''' indie website - a personal website that's easy to read and interact with on a mobile device
* '''mobile use-cases''' - things you want to do with your mobile device that involve collecting or publishing data, or communication, and thus make sense to consider solving with the use of an indieweb site.
* '''mobile apps''' to access and use your indieweb site. Both mobile web apps and mobile native apps.

== mobile friendly ==
To make your indie website mobile friendly:
* [[icon]] - make sure you've setup an icon for readers to easily add your indieweb site to their mobile device home screen
* [[design]] - implement good responsive design so your website is readable on mobile devices, and focuses on showing content first or very close to the top (rather than sidebars and other widgets).
* [[communication]] - setup your personal website so that when users access it on a mobile communication device, it presents them with mobile communication options for getting in touch with you.
* [[posting]] - implement a good mobile posting interface for your indie website so you can create [[posts]], perhaps even take and post [[photos]] from your mobile device(s).
* [[offline]] - implement some amount of offline support in your website so people can browse and read your posts even if their network connection is unreliable or unavailable

As we figure out and implement such mobile friendliness on our own websites, they may make sense as additional '''[[IndieMark]]''' features to measure.

== mobile use-cases ==
There are numerous mobile use-cases that drive the development of mobile friendly indieweb sites and mobile apps for indieweb sites. These could all be expanded:

Mobile web apps, beyond web apps, are expected to make use of mobile devices' capabilities.

Here is a site that tracks the progress of WebAPIs to access various features on mobile devices:
