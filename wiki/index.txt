__TOC__

== Page type ==
{{main|wiki-page}}

In addition to sequential / time-ordered [[posts]], many in the IndieWebCamp community either want to or already host a wiki or wiki pages on their own personal site.

Wiki pages are typically editable and versioned with visible / easily accessible version history & browsable versions. Wiki pages are often also multi-authored and have a multi-platform interface (like any web-based content hosting solution).

* [[User:Tommorris.org|Tom Morris]] has his own wiki at http://wiki.tommorris.org/
* ...

There are also various wiki hosting sites / [[silos]].

== Projects ==
{{main|wiki-projects}}

IndieWebCamp [[projects]] related to wiki hosting/creation/editing:

* [[Federated Wiki]]
** as conceived/created/developed/launched at IndieWebCamp [[2011]]
* [[MediaWiki]]
** Used by [[User:Tommorris.org|Tom Morris]] on wiki.tommorris.org.

== Done ==
Suggestions that have been implemented.

=== Search box in header ===
'''Done 2013-314''': Moved to: https://github.com/indieweb/wiki/issues/1

=== Login from any page ===
'''Done 2013-238''': Log in link in the top right corner of every page. Turns in to a log out link when you're logged in. [[User:Aaronparecki.com|Aaronparecki.com]] 16:02, 26 August 2013 (PDT)

The home page has a "Login with your domain" box in the top right corner.

EVERY page should have that box so that you can login easily/quickly from any page (without having to hunt for the small login link in the footer.)

I desperately need the ability to login to the wiki from '''any''' page... right now it's the biggest "flow" breaker, which means I don't edit as frequently as I could - [[User:Sandeep.io|Sandeep Shetty]]

:+1:, it takes me quite some time to figure out there is a small "login" link at the bottom of a page. The more natural flow for new comers: [[User:Hupili.net|Hupili.net]] 22:23, 9 July 2013 (PDT)

* Find a '''big''' login at the top of any page. (people may start to have interest of IndieWeb from different points)
* Since they have interest, they try to click the "login"
* They are prompted that '''IndieAuth''' is used and there is a [[Quick Login Setup]]. (there are too many things that are not need for a first timer to simply login)


=== IRC today redirect ===
'''Done 2013-151'''

Create a live redirect from:
* http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/today
To:
* http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/YYYY-MM-DD of the current day (the most current log page, based on the server, not the viewer's timezone)


=== What Links Here ===
'''Done 2013-142''' (or a day or so before that?) - Aaronpk took care of it. - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 18:05, 23 May 2013 (PDT)

* Please enable the "What Links Here" links for pages so we can better track down broken links etc. and fix them.
** E.g. for the main page:
*** http://http://indiewebcamp.com/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/Main_Page
*** perhaps between the "Special pages" and "Permanent link" links in the footer.

=== Improve CSS for a more liquid layout ===
'''Done 2013-03 - forgot the exact date. Aaronpk took care of it. - [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek]] 16:49, 1 April 2013 (PDT)'''
----
Update the CSS to at least make the layout a bit more liquid (gooey?) rather than set to its current fixed width which is actually too wide for good reading (~60 characters per line is a good max, we're way above that).

Per http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-02-19#t1361291725
# in [http://indiewebcamp.com/wiki/skins/indieweb/styles/gumax_cyborg/gumax_cyborg.css gumax_cyborg.css], change <code>width: 977px</code> to <code>max-width: 977px</code>
# in [http://indiewebcamp.com/wiki/skins/indieweb/gumax_template.css gumax_template.css], comment out like this: <code>/* width: 777px */</code>

That will give at least a bit of a range of liquid layout so we can avoid some horizontal scrollbars (and line lengths that are too long for optimal reading).
