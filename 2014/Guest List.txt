|-

! style="background:#ffdead;" | '''Creators''': Add yourself
! style="background:#ffdecc;" | '''Bloggers''': blog your RSVP
! style="background:#ffdede;" | '''Apprentices''': Get your creator to add you

|-


| Are you a '''[[Creator]]''' (create & share ''design, UI/UX, and/or code'')? Add yourself to the guest list by '''[[Special:UserLogin|Logging in]] with your own domain!'''

| Already blogging on your own domain? Great! '''Publish a post saying that you're coming with a link to [https://indiewebcamp.com/2014/Guest_List this RSVP page]''' and send a [[pingback]] to it.

| Perhaps you're a creator, but only for other people, and don't actively create things for your own site. Or maybe you're really excited about the IndieWeb and want to join it as soon as you can!

|-

| Add yourself to the [[#Creators]] section using the [[Template:Attendee|attendee template]], then add your name linked to your wiki user page and a self-hosted profile photo 128px square. 

| If you're an active blogger (i.e. at least once a month)  yet don't feel like you would call yourself a creator, it would still be great to have you participate in IndieWebCamp. If you can setup [[IndieAuth]] on your domain, go ahead and add yourself in the [[#Bloggers]] section as well.

| If you're not a creator, but want to be, or want to create and contribute to the IndieWeb but don't know where to start, team up with a creator, and ask them to add you. You can still attend IndieWebCamp as an apprentice to a creator. 

|}

Create your account, then add yourself using the [[Template:Attendee|attendee template]]:
* Your name linked to your wiki user page
* Your profile photo
* Your personal, IndieWeb URL
* Your organization and URL (optional)
* Links to IndieWeb projects that you have running on your site, are working on, or have contributed to.
* Links to your other web profiles (optional)

Then consider adding IndieWebCamp [[buttons]] to your website.
