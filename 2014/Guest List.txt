== Requirements ==
=== personal identity ===
To add yourself to the guest list:
# '''[[Special:UserLogin|Log in]] with your own domain!'''
# Add yourself to the [[#Creators]] section


Using your Google/Facebook/Github or other [[silo]] URL as your identity is not indie enough!

If you're serious about the Indie Web, then you can demonstrate that by [[How_to_set_up_IndieAuth_on_your_own_domain|setting up your own domain]].

=== creators only ===
Like previous years, [[2012/Guest_List#creators_only|2012]], [[2013/Guest_List#creators_only|2013]], IndieWebCamp 2014 is for active [[Creators|creators]] only in order to focus the limited time we have on productive real world discussions and code/design/ux sharing that will help us move forward.

Being a creator means you must do one or more of:
* '''code'''. create or contribute to indieweb open source projects
* '''design'''. create or contribute to indieweb designs, graphic, layout, adaptive or otherwise.
* '''ux'''. create wireframes or other indieweb user interface flows 

As an ''indieweb'' creator, you must be using the things you create (code, design, ux) on your personal site.

As an indieweb ''camp'' creator, you must ''share'' at least some small part of what you create and run on your personal site.

Still not sure if you're an indieweb creator?

Check out the [[Creator]] wiki page.

=== apprentices to creators ===
Perhaps <span id="apprentices_to_builders">you</span> don't have a personal site.

Perhaps you're a creator, but only for other people, and don't actively create things for your own site.

Maybe you're really excited about the IndieWeb and want to join it as soon as you can!

You can still attend IndieWebCamp as an apprentice to a creator.

A creator may bring an apprentice, and is completely responsible for them.

If you're not a creator, but want to be, or want to create and contribute to the indieweb but don't know where to start, team up with a creator, and ask them to add you. 

In the meantime, be sure to get setup with your own personal identity so you can contribute to the wiki, and start learning what you can do to add your personal site to the indie web.

== Official Guest List ==
'''Venue Capacity: 50'''
* signed-up: 
* spots remaining: 50

Want to help? [[2014/Planning|Sign up to volunteer!]].

Create your account, then add yourself using the [[Template:Attendee|attendee template]]:
* Your name linked to your wiki user page
* Your profile photo
* Your personal, IndieWeb URL
* Your organization and URL (optional)
* Links to IndieWeb projects that you have running on your site, are working on, or have contributed to.
* Links to your other web profiles (optional)

Then consider adding IndieWebCamp [[buttons]] to your website.
