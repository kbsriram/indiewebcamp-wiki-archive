<span class="p-summary"> [[Loqi]] does not like the backtick in {{gRegor}}'s screen name <code>gRegor`</code>, so you can give karma to username <code>gregornobacktick</code> in the meantime . . . </span>

Until {{aaronpk}} puts the Loqi regex in a repo so we can try to fix the backtick recognition, at least. ;]
