'''<dfn>messaging</dfn>''' refers to one user sending another user a message. There are numerous technologies for such personal messaging.

== Brainstorming ==
=== IndieWeb Messaging ===
{{main|indieweb-messaging}}

Some in the indieweb community are brainstorming how to best do messaging from one indieweb presence to another. See the [[indieweb-messaging]] page for more.

=== IndieWeb Authentication ===
Even while using other methods of [[communication]], is it possible to use someone's IndieWeb site in the process of authenticating them to make sure they are who you think they are?

== IndieWeb Perspectives ==
=== Tantek ===
From an "indieweb" perspective, I find this transition from email to other forms of [[communication]] both interesting, and perhaps useful for clues as to where/how indieweb communication should work - that is, *why* are people migrating from email (supposedly open, federated, etc.) to other solutions which are seemingly more friendly, more usable, faster / lower latency, less noisy, quicker, etc.

I think there is unexplored promise in this use-case: [[sign-in-use-cases#messaging]]

And perhaps we also have an opportunity to define what "friending" on the indieweb means - perhaps it means two people have agreed to let each other send indieweb personal messages back/forth.

(and like [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-08-21/line/1377129620 bret says], I have [[email#Maintenance_disinterest|zero desire to figure out / implement SMTP or IMAP or POP on my own server]].) we can do better with web technologies and how modern messaging solutions have raised the bar in terms of UI/UX (compared to email).

== Technologies ==
Existing electronic messaging technologies and networks.

=== Email ===
{{main|email}}
Email uses technologies such as:
* SMTP
* POP/IMAP
* MIME
Email typically allows anyone that knows your email address to send you a message, which has resulted in a poisoning of the technology, anywhere from spam, to vendor "donotreply@" messages, to badly written emails to mailing lists.

For this reason, many have abandoned email for day-to-day critical personal messaging and instead use one of the other solutions: iMessage, FB Messenger, DM, or even SMS. See below.

=== PM ===
Private messaging. PM is a term for sending people private messages in IRC.
* [[IRC]]

=== IM ===
Instant messaging.
* [[XMPP]] / Jabber
Proprietary clients/networks:
* [[AOL]] Instant Messenger (AIM)
* [[Google]] Talk (AKA Gtalk)
* [[Microsoft]] MSN Messenger
* [[Facebook]] Messenger

=== SMS MMS ===
SMS AKA txting requires the sender to know the receiver's cell phone number. Anyone that knows your mobile/cell number can send you a text message from their cell phone.

MMS is used for sending media such as photos in otherwise "text" messages.

SMS can also be used with [[indieauth]]

=== DM ===
Direct messaging. Invented by [[Twitter]], direct messaging uses Twitter's site and typically clients (though there is also an SMS interface) to send messages which can then be received on a Twitter client, as well as optionally in [[email]] or by SMS, or both.

=== iMessage ===
iMessage is Apple's proprietary messaging network where iOS devices (iPhone, iPad, iPod touch) and Macs with Messsages App installed can send messages to each other similar to SMS or MMS messages. 

On iOS, "Messages" *is* the SMS application, and if both sender and recipient are registered with apple (e.g. their iPhone phone numbers, or AppleID email address), then the devices attempt to route the messages directly via Apple's servers, rather than the phone/SMS network.
