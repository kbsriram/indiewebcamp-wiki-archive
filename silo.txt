A '''<dfn>silo</dfn>''', or web content hosting silo, in the context of the IndieWeb, is a centralized web site typically owned by a for-profit corporation that stakes some claim to content contributed to it and restricts access in some way (has walls).

Silos are characterized by the following:
* require you to create an account specific to that site to use it (silo identity)
* allow you to interact on the site <em>only</em> with others with accounts on the site (silo contacts / social network)
* allows you to post some type of content (text, hypertext, images, video)
* and typically one or more of the following:
** an access wall that prevents indexing of (at least some of the) content you contribute
** a restrictive terms of service (TOS)
** claims some ownership or license to any content you create within the silo
** restricts your ability to import/export your content, or content about your content (e.g. comments, tags)

== Other Silos ==
* [http://www.cybe.com/ Cybe] appears to be a splash screen and silo at cybe.me with a ton of rhetoric ("manifesto", "vision", etc.).

== Silo Quitting ==
A number of individuals, prominent and otherwise, have publicly "quit" various silos
* [[silo-quits]]

== Linkwrapping ==
Many silos wrap any links posted on them with their own domains or link-wrapping domains, sometimes in an attempt to make links shorter, sometimes to provide a bottleneck which they can use to mass disable spam/phishing links. 

Downsides:
* '''Breaks link referrals''' (you just see the silo wrapper, not the actual post that linked to your domain)
* '''Fragile''' for all the usual link-shorteners by a site other than the owner are fragile problem. As well as their typical use of [[database]] ids.

Examples:
* [[Facebook]]: m.facebook.com/l.php...[https://twitter.com/kyle_wm/status/446818317408280576]
