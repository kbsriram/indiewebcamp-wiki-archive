== Mobile ==
Mobile note creation is particularly challenging for various reasons:
* less reliable network (thus possible loss of user data if depending on JS / AJAX)
* smaller displays (less space to see what you're typing)
* touch keyboards (clumsier / less accurate than physical tactile keyboard)
