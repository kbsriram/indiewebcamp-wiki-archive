== About IndieWebCamp ==

IndieWebCamp is a gathering of web creators building and sharing open web technologies to advance the state of the indie web. We get together for a weekend to talk about what has been done to empower people to own their online identities, and then spend a day hacking and creating.

The event will attract roughly 40 highly engaged people interested in advancing the state of the open independent web.

== Sponsorship ==

Here are ways you can help sponsor one of the next IndieWebCamp [[events]]

* '''venue''' - volunteer to host an IndieWebCamp event
* '''food''' - cover the cost and delivery of any of the following for day 1 or 2 of IndieWebCamp:
** '''pre-event drinkup''' - cover the tab at a nearby pub
** '''breakfast snacks''' (fruit, pastries, bagels)
** '''coffee''' (morning and/or afternoon)
** '''lunch'''
** '''dinner'''
** '''post-event drinkup''' - cover the tab at a nearby pub (would need to commit about $150)
* '''supplies''' - giant sticky notes, sketch paper, pens, etc.

Your contribution will be used to fund the ingredients that will make IndieWebCamp a success, including the venue, printing costs, and refreshments. While there are no formal speaking slots available, anyone from your team is welcome to attend either as a [[creator]] or an apprentice if you don't yet have your own domain name.
