== About IndieWebCamp ==

IndieWebCamp is a gathering of web creators building and sharing open web technologies to advance the state of the web. We get together for two days to talk about what has been done to empower people to own their online identities, and then spend a day hacking and creating.

The events attract roughly 20-60 highly engaged people interested in advancing the state of the open independent web. Each event is kept small to encourage major participation by leaders in tech, journalism and design.
