== Troubleshooting ==
=== session start failed ===
If you get an error like:
<blockquote style="font-family:monospace">
Warning: session_start() [function.session-start]: open(/home/.../tmp/sess_..., O_RDWR) failed: No such file or directory
</blockquote>
* Look like the server can't write to <samp>/home/.../tmp/</samp>
** so either it used to be able to, or it used to write to some other path
** ssh in, and see what the permissions for <samp>/home/tantek/tmp</samp>
* Or it's possible the session.save_path configuration changed. http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.session-save-path.php

Possible resolutions:
* if your [[webhosting]] is a '''shared server'''
** start a ticket with your hosting provider, OR
** add this code to your PHP application somewhere before session access: <blockquote style="whitespace:pre"><code>if (!is_dir(ini_get('session.save_path'))) {<br/>  mkdir(ini_get('session.save_path'), 0700, true);<br/>}</code></blockquote>
*** This code auto-creates the PHP session storage directory if it doesn't already exist.
