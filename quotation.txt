{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>quotation</dfn>''' is a type of post that includes a subset of the contents of another post, and a [[citation]] of that other post.

A quotation of the entirety of another post should be a [[repost]] instead.

A quotation which uses the name/title of another post (rather than its content) should be a [[bookmark]] instead.

== How to markup ==
A quotation can be minimally marked up as a [[note]], with the entry content (<code>e-content</code>) containing:
* a <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> that wraps the quoted text itself (including explicit quotes "" “”)
* a <code>&lt;cite class="h-cite"&gt;</code> that wraps a citation of the source of the quotation, with at a minimum:
** a nested hyperlink (<code>&lt;a href&gt;</code>) linking to the source, ideally using a [[fragmention]] directly to (at least the start of) the quotation.
** link text of the name of the article/book/source

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} posts [[bookmarks]] on http://aaronparecki.com/bookmarks using [[p3k]] since 2014-09-07 (and using [[WordPress]] from 2006-12-10 to 2014-09-06), some of which are entire quotations, e.g.:
* http://aaronparecki.com/bookmarks/2014/06/11/1/
* http://aaronparecki.com/bookmarks/2014/04/30/2/
* http://aaronparecki.com/bookmarks/2012/04/04/1/

== Silo Examples ==
* [[Tumblr]] supports an explicit quotation post kind, and presents quotation posts differently from other posts. (needs screenshots using default Tumblr skin)
