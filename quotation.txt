{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>quotation</dfn>''' is a type of post that includes a subset of the contents of another post, and a [[citation]] of that other post.

A quotation of the entirety of another post should be a [[repost]] instead.

A quotation which uses the name/title of another post (rather than its content) should be a [[bookmark]] instead.
