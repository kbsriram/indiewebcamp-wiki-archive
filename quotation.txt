{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>quotation</dfn>''' is a type of post that includes a subset of the contents of another post, and a [[citation]] of that other post.

A quotation of the entirety of another post should be a [[repost]] instead.

A quotation which uses the name/title of another post (rather than its content) should be a [[bookmark]] instead.

== How to markup ==
A quotation can be minimally marked up as a [[note]], with the entry content (<code>e-content</code>) containing:
* a <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> that wraps the quoted text itself (including explicit quotes "" “”)
* a <code>&lt;cite class="h-cite"&gt;</code> that wraps a citation of the source of the quotation, with at a minimum:
** a nested hyperlink (<code>&lt;a href&gt;</code>) linking to the source, ideally using a [[fragmention]] directly to (at least the the start of) the quotation.
** link text of the name of the article/book/source

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Aaron Parecki ===
{{aaronpk}} uses [[WordPress]] to post [[bookmarks]] on aaron.pk/bookmarks since ????-??-??, some of which are entire quotations, e.g.:
* http://aaron.pk/bookmarks/?bookmark=the-value-of-a-founders-time
* http://aaron.pk/bookmarks/?bookmark=to-everyone-who-is-complaining-about-popular-science-shutting-down-comments
* http://aaron.pk/bookmarks/?bookmark=dylans-desk-frustration-and-fragmentation-rule-the-mobile-industry-for-now

== Silo Examples ==
* [[Tumblr]] supports an explicit quotation post kind, and presents quotation posts differently from other posts. (needs screenshots using default Tumblr skin)
