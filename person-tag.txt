{{stub}}

A '''<dfn>person tag</dfn>''' (AKA <dfn>people tag</dfn>) is a special kind of [[tag]] that refers to a specific person by URL rather than just a word or phrase, and is done as an explicit tag by the user, beyond just mentioning a person via hyperlink / h-card.

== Why ==
By supporting people tags in [[posts]], you can more explicitly/automatically notify people via [[webmention]] to their [[homepage]] at their URL that you have explicitly tagged a post as being about them, e.g. a [[photo]] post where they're in the photo.

== How ==
You can tag a post with a <em>person-tag</em> (as opposed to just a plain text tag) by using an h-card for the p-category element inside an h-entry:

<pre><nowiki>
<a class="p-category h-card" 
   href="http://ben.thatmustbe.me/">Ben Roberts</a>
</nowiki></pre>

That will tag the current h-entry as being about the person Ben Roberts of http://ben.thatmustbe.me/.

If the current h-entry has a "u-tag-of" link to another post, then it is a [[tag-reply]] that tags that <em>other</em> post as being about the person Ben Roberts of http://ben.thatmustbe.me/.

A post can of course contain multiple such person-tags, thus tagging the post as being about all of them, or the post that is u-tag-of linked to, as about all of them.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
=== Kevin Marks ===
{{kevinmarks}} has person-tags on his notes from [[events/2014-11-19-homebrew-website-club|Homebrew Website Club 2014-11-19]] (posted on that date). First known real-world use of publishing proposed person-tags.

== IndieWeb Interest ==
=== Kyle Mahan ===
{{kylewm}}: <blockquote>I'm interested in having "in this photo: list of names" type tags, but not so much tagging x/y coordinates</blockquote>

=== Tantek ===
{{t}} I am interested in helping solve this problem to escape the "50 person-tags limit" in [[Facebook]] photos (as documented below in [[#Silo_Examples]]). A group I am involved with posts group photos every week with more than 50 people and people get left out because of this limitation[https://www.facebook.com/NovemberProjectSF/photos/a.529728270497004.1073741955.276430682493432/529729277163570/?type=1&comment_id=530291480440683&offset=0&total_comments=4]. I don't want people to be left out.

=== Ben Roberts ===
{{benthatmustbeme}} I am interested in being able to tag people with co-ordinates as well.  I am working on adding the code needed to have a test implementation soon based on Tantek's ideas [http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-11-19 in the chat]

=== The Dod ===
{{thedod}} Personally, I find tagging to be a dangerous habbit (especially today, when face recognition is becoming more and more available to governments and more common criminals). I may be old fashioned, but I believe that any person-tagging protocol should involve consent or "moderation" by the person being tagged. The protocol should require some way of ''privately'' informing the tag's target that there's a photo (perhaps of something that "happened in Vegas") and the target should confirm to the source (e.g. via clicking a link and posting a form with the picture and a ''"This is me and you can publish that this is me"'' checkbox).
If it didn't happen (or if there's no way to reach the target), it should be considered '''bad manners''' to publish such a tag. At least IMHO.

== Silo Examples ==
The following [[silos]] support people tagging and are thus a good starting point for documenting people-tagging user experiences for recreation on indieweb sites.
* [[Facebook]] - all post types, an explicit text mention is interpreted as a people tag, plus you can explicitly people tag areas of photo posts. '''Limitation:''' you can only tag up to 50 people in a photo on Facebook.[https://www.facebook.com/NovemberProjectSF/photos/a.529728270497004.1073741955.276430682493432/529729277163570/?type=1&comment_id=530291480440683&offset=0&total_comments=4]
* [[Flickr]] - you can people tag a photo and optionally denote a rectangle of the photo that indicates that person.
* [[Instagram]] - you can people tag a photo and optionally denote a point on the photo (from which the label of the person's name is hung).
* [[Twitter]] - photos in tweets can be people-tagged - [https://blog.twitter.com/2014/photos-just-got-more-social see details].
* [[Google+]] - photos can be people-tagged - [https://support.google.com/plus/answer/1304814 see details].

== Brainstorming ==
=== HTML imagemaps ===
[[User:benwerd.com|Ben Werdmuller]] wondered if you could tag people in photos by linking to their profiles using HTML imagemaps (!) and marking up the imagemap links with microformats. That might look something like:

<code><img src="some_photo.jpg" alt="Tantek, Aaron and Amber!" usemap="#peeps" class="u-photo">

<map name="peeps">

<area shape="circle" coords="124,58,8" class="microcard h-card u-url" href="http://tantek.com" alt="Tantek Ã‡elik">

<area shape="rect" coords="0,0,82,126" class="microcard h-card u-url"  href="http://aaronparecki.com" alt="Aaron Parecki">

<area shape="circle" coords="90,58,3" class="microcard h-card u-url" href="http://caseorganic.com" alt="Amber Case">

</map></code>

However, because the HTML syntax of imagemaps sits outside the actual image tag, it may be worth adding a microformat to the map itself.

=== Basic Person Tagging example ===

<pre><nowiki>
<span class="h-entry">
 <a class="p-author h-card" href="http://a.example.com/">Alice</a> 
 tagged 
 <a href="http://b.example.com/" class="p-category h-card">Bob Smith</a> and 
 <a href="http://c.example.com/" class="p-category h-card">Cole Train</a> 
  in 
 <a class="u-tag-of u-in-reply-to" href="http://s.example.com/permalink47">
  <img src="http://s.example.com/photo47.png" alt="a photo of Bob and Cole" /></a>
</span>
</nowiki></pre>

== SWAT0 ==
People tagging was one of the steps of the [[SWAT0]] social web acid test developed / proposed in 2010.
