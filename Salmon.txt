'''<dfn>[http://www.salmon-protocol.org/ Salmon]</dfn>''' is a 2010-era [[feed]]-based protocol for sending [[comment]] notifications that is part of the [[OStatus]] stack.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
There are no known examples of indieweb sites supporting or using the Salmon Protocol.

Instead, indieweb sites are using the much simpler [[webmention]] protocol to send notifications about [[comments]] to the item that is being replied-to.
