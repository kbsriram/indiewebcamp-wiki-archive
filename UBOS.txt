[[File:ubos-logo-big.png|frame]] UBOS (pronounced You-Boss) is a new Linux distro that aims to make it much simpler to deploy web applications on headless hardware owned by the users. Even geeks often have a hard time finding out how to install web apps, or regularly backing them up or upgrading them. For non-geeks, it's totally impossible, which is one of the reasons they need to go to the big silos instead of the indie web. UBOS is intended to make this much more accessible to geeks and humans, so everybody can have their own site under they own control.

UBOS uses a rolling-release model, which means that no "major" upgrades are ever required. UBOS also uses several release channels that contain software with different levels of maturity.

The UBOS release process tests the entire stack: operating system, middleware, and the installation, uninstallation, backup, restore and (some) functionality of web apps included in UBOS.

UBOS fully supports multiple virtual hosts, and multiple independent installations of the same app at different virtual hostnames or paths. This enables a family, for example, to run independent websites for each family member at different hostnames but with overlapping applications.
