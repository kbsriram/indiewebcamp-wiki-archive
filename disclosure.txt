A '''<dfn>disclosure</dfn>''' is a bit of content, typically on a [[home page]], on an indie web site that proactively discloses some aspect about the site that the site owner wants the user to explicitly be aware of. E.g.

* cookie tracking
* analytics
* affiliations with organizations (sometimes on specific [[posts]] that are topically related to those organizations)
* services provided, such as webmentions.

* Jeremy Zilar on his [http://silencematters.com/ silencematters.com] sidebar, has a Google Analytics disclosure and links to opt out and learn more: <blockquote>Note:<br/>I use Google Analytics to understand how people are using my website.<br/>Opt-out | Learn more</blockquote>
