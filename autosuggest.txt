= Autosuggest =

At IndieWebCamp [[2012]] a bunch of participants noted that there are several building blocks we need in order to advance the indieweb beyond just being a collection of hyperlinked independent websites. One of those is the notion of '''Indie autosuggest''', in particular, for typing/picking a person, e.g. using their name or alias (@-name or otherwise).

== Patterns ==

There are plenty of documented design patterns around the web for single line, static-content inputs (e.g. tag inputs, email To/CC/BCC), but hardly anything for multi-line, dynamic-content UIs where autosuggest is context-sensitive.

=== Examples in the Wild ===

==== Mobile ====

* iOS built in Tweet Sheet UI
** Brings up suggestion UI on first character ''after'' @, no autosuggest for #tags
** Requires tap on UI to accept autosuggestion
** Backspace does not exit autosuggestion UI
** @name autosuggestion UI shows @name, full name, profile photo
** Photos: [http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/m3 iPad] [http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/m4 iPhone]
* iOS Native Official Twitter App
** Brings up autosuggest UI on @ or # character entry
** Requires tap on UI to accept autosuggestion
** Backspace exits autosuggestion UI
** @name autosuggestion shows @name, full name and profile photo
** Photos: [http://photos.waterpigs.co.uk/p/m2 iPad]

==== Web ====

* Twitter.com Compose Tweet Box
** Brings up suggestion UI on first character ''after'' @, no #tag autosuggest support
** Autosuggestion UI is a dropdown menu below the textarea
** Return accepts autosuggestion and appends a space, spacebar does nothing
** Backspace exits autosuggestion UI
** @name autosuggestion shows @name, full name and profile photo

In conclusion, there is almost no consistency between UIs across platforms or even between platforms. 

Common denominators (add more as they emerge):

* @name autosuggestion shows @name, full name and profile photo

The 2012 Portland [[2012/Sign_In_With_Your_Name|Sign In With Your Name]] and [[2012/Open_Real_Time_Search_Engine|Open Real Time Search Engine]] sessions both discussed indie autosuggest a lot, and resulted in some code demonstrated as part of the [[2012/Demos#Open_Follow|Open Follow]] hack ([https://github.com/evanp/openfollow code on github]).
