'''<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/h-card h-card]</dfn>''' is the [[microformats2]] vocabulary for marking up people, organizations, and venues on web sites.

Each indie website should have an h-card on the homepage, preferably containing at least '''name''', '''url''' and '''photo''' (or '''logo''') properties â€” just these three cover most h-card usage on the indieweb, e.g. putting a name and face to comments or URLs.

These requirements can be satisfied by two elements with one classname, for example:

<pre>
<a class="h-card" href="http://waterpigs.co.uk"><img class="/photo.png" alt="" /> Barnaby Walters</a>
</pre>

Having a minimal h-card on your index page allows [[Gravatar]]-like lookups based on [[Why_web_sign-in#Why_not_emaildomain instead of email address]].
