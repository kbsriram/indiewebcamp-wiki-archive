{{stub}}

'''<dfn>Google+</dfn>''' is a content hosting [[silo]] operated by [[Google]]. Also written (and spoken) as "Google Plus", and sometimes written as "GPlus" or "G+".

== API ==
Google+ has a proprietary read API.

=== Activities ===
Google+ has a proprietary Activities API that is based on (but not actually) [[ActivityStreams]]:
* https://developers.google.com/+/api/latest/activities

== Exporting your data ==
[https://www.google.com/takeout/ Google Takeout] lets you download a zip with all of your Google+ posts, comments, pictures, etc.

[http://www.freedom.io/ freedom.io] ([https://github.com/snarfed/freedom source]) can copy all of your posts to [[WordPress]], [[Tumblr]], or [[Blogger]], creating a new blog post for each, with the original dates and all comments intact.

== POSSE ==
There's currently no good way to automatically [[POSSE]] to Google+. Here are the (bad) options:
* Use the [https://developers.google.com/+/api/latest/moments Moments API]. As far as we know, though, it doesn't actually surface to users yet.
* Apply for the [https://developers.google.com/+/api/pages-signup partner-only Pages API].
* Make a business relationship with Google so you can use a private/partner API, like [[WordPress]]'s [http://jetpack.me/support/publicize/ Jetpack Publicize]. [http://jetpack.me/support/publicize/google/ More] [https://twitter.com/justinshreve/status/411154097522233345 details]. Here's an example: [http://www.cogiddo.com/2013/12/test-post-for-the-new-integration-with-google/ original post], [https://plus.google.com/+DimitriosDiamantaras/posts/gyrwmds81hU Google+ post].
* Screen-scrape and use the web endpoints as if you were a normal user. [http://www.nextscripts.com/social-networks-auto-poster-for-wordpress/ NextScripts SNAP] does this.


=== Background ===
There is some evidence that Google+ "+1"s on links affect their search ranking:
* <span class="h-cite"><time class="dt-published">2013-08-20</time> <span class="p-publisher">The Moz Blog</span> / <span class="p-author h-card">Cyrus-Shepard</span>: <span class="p-name">Amazing Correlation Between Google +1s and Higher Search Rankings</span> (<cite class="u-url">http://moz.com/blog/google-plus-correlations</cite>)</span>
POSSEing links of your [[posts]] to Google+ may help increase +1s on them and thus increase their search ranking.

==== Will Norris ====
In <cite>[https://willnorris.com/2011/09/outsourcing-comments-to-google Outsourcing comments to Google+]</cite>, [[2011]] IndieWebCamp participant Will Norris explains how he uses 
* [https://willnorris.com/2011/09/launching-the-google-platform Google+ read API]
* [https://developers.google.com/+/web/+1button/ Google+ +1 button]
* in his [https://github.com/willnorris/wordpress-snowflake snowflake] plugin for [[WordPress]]
to <em>manually</em> create links to his blog posts on Google+ where he then accepts comments (instead of comments on his own blog).

This isn't a full POSSE implementation (which would be cross-posting the entirety of the contents of your blog posts to G+ posts), but rather just a way to manually share links/summaries of your original posts onto G+, similar to [[Twitter#POSSE_Articles_to_Twitter|POSSEing articles to Twitter]].

=== Brainstorming ===
==== Events ====
Anecdotally there seems to be more interaction on G+ [[event]] posts than simple text posts.

If we can figure out a way to automatically create event posts on G+, it might be worth POSSEing indieweb event posts to G+.

== Searchability ==
It's not obvious how to best publish/POSSE to or comment on G+ in a way that is most easily searchable / findable. Here are some tips:

* only post public posts to G+
* ...

== Issues ==
=== Lack of comment permalinks ===
[[Comments]] on Google+ lack their own permalinks, making it very difficult to reference a part of a conversation on a Google+ post.

It's apparently a "Known feature request that's never made it to the head of the priority queue." according to:
* https://plus.google.com/+AdeOshineye/posts/6zUWbNKbWrM

Similarly when asked at the 2013 Google I/O conference, Google+ representatives relayed the same message that it's a known feature request and there are still no plans for it.
