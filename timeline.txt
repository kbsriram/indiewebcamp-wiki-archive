2003:

Rise of Pingback Spam

Decline of Personal Sites
*Distracted by RSS/ATOM wars, blogs began to decline
*Hosted blogs, people turned to social networks more than blogging 
*Eventual fade of RSS/ATOM

2010: State of Blogs
*Not much personal blog activity
*WordPress heavy and dominant

2013:
*Github hosted blogs, Medium for frontpage Hacker News

Siloed blogging and writing frameworks. 
*MEDIUM: Don’t claim ownership but reserve the right to use your content even if they get acquired in the future. 
*Wikia: Communities don’t own their content and can’t transfer it off their site. 

Differences between 2013 and 2003 
*Short status updates became an acceptable form of content 
*Easy enough to show an entire conversation or a link to another page 

[[2011]] (E): IndieWebCamp Conf
*Purpose: Show, don’t tell 
*Builders Only. Must have your own domain name and actively build stuff for it to attend. 
*Use your domain name and OpenID to sign into the IndieWebCamp MediaWiki. http://indiewebcamp.com/
*Could only add self to the attendee list if you use your domain name to log into the site.

2012: 
*IndieAuth implemented on IndieWebCamp.com (replaced OpenID)
*2012-06 (E): [[2012|IndieWebCamp2012]]: changed from Builders-only to Creators-only to more explicitly include UX+design
**Again, could only add self to the attendee list if you use your domain name to log into the site.
*Domain Name, rel=me, mediawiki
* 2012-09 (E): [[2012/UK|IndieWebCampUK 2012]] (first in the UK)
