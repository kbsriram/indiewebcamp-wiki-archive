<dfn>'''Tantek-ing'''</dfn> refers to a method of encouraging people to make edits to this wiki. {{tantek}} frequently asks "What is ___?" in [[IRC]]. [[Loqi]] will then respond with a prompt to create the page if it does not exist yet.

<blockquote>
shaners: What is flask?<br>
Loqi: It looks like we don't have a page for "flask" yet. Would you like to create it? http://indiewebcamp.com/wiki/index.php?action=edit&title=flask<br>
kylewm: what!<br>
â€¦<br>
KartikPrabhu: shaners++ for successfully tantek-ing kylewm ;)
