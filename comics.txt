'''<dfn>comics</dfn>''' are one of many types of [[posts]] that you can publish on your own site.

== Distinguishing Features ==
Comics are very similar in ways to [[articles]], [[notes]], and [[photos]], yet have an interesting / different enough presentation that they're worthy of consideration as their own post type.

Comics:
* typically consist of a primary image - like a [[photo]]
* (sometimes) incorporate the post name (title) into the comic image itself
* (sometimes) incorporate the post creation date (dt-published) into the comic image itself
* (sometimes) incorporate the post author into the comic image itself
* can provide nicely structured fallback content as structure text markup, e.g. including:
** text description of the comic strip graphics
** paragraph markup of the dialog in the comic cells
** text expansion of comic creation date and signature
* commentary or descriptive text about the comic (in addition to the image, not as fallback)

Some of these aspects have strong impacts on aspects of presentation.

E.g. if the comic strip image incorporates the name (post name), then there is no reason to display a separate heading of the post name above the comic image - neither in an aggregate view (e.g. a home page's recent updates stream), nor on a permalink.

Similar to a photo, the comic image should be the first thing at the top of the post.

However, different from a photo, the comic image should use an &lt;object&gt; element, and place well structured fall back text covering at a minimum the description of visuals in the cells of the comic, and the dialog in the cells.

Given the extra explicit structure in comics posts' fallback markup, it seems reasonable to treat them as a special kind of [[article]] - one where the name of the article should only be visible in the fallback content, and otherwise, the image should be first.

== IndieWeb Examples ==
* [[User:Tantek.com|Tantek Ã‡elik]] is publishing comics on his own site, following most of the above, e.g.:
** http://tantek.com/2013/149/b1/bayesian
* [[User:Werd.io|Ben Werd]] is publishing comics on his own site, following Tantek's example, and using a plugin incorporated into [[idno]], eg:
** http://werd.io/comic/51e0a67dbed7de5277b4c530/indiecomix-indieweb
* [[User:WaterPigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] publishes the occasional comic, e.g.
** http://waterpigs.co.uk/notes/4SzE1F/
