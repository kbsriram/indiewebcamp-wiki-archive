'''<dfn>[https://github.com/bear/indie-stats indie-stats]</dfn>''' is a Python open source [[project]] that will gather mf2 data for IndieWeb domains and generate stats.

Generates a [https://bear.im/indie-stats/domains.json domains.json] file for each domain with metadata for the site and it's status - this is needed because quite a few of them are 404 or timeouts.

== Features ==
* Crawl IndieWeb domains and store
** mf2 data
** html content
** request and response headers
* Maintain metadata for domains showing their current status
* Domain list was seeded from [[IRC-people]]

== Working On ==
=== Generate stats ===
For each domain crawled the domain, timestamp and data will be passed to a master "cruncher" that will then loop thru a list of stat generating apps. The resulting json blob from this generating app will be added along with namespace and timestamp to the stat history for the domain.

=== Domain opt-in and opt-out ===
Add an endpoint to allow for both opt-in and out for a domain owner - needs to be backed by IndieAuth.

=== Stat retrieval ===
Add an endpoint to allow for a call to be made for a domain and a date range and the response will be the json blob of stats.
