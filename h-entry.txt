'''<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry h-entry]</dfn>''' is the [[microformats2]] vocabulary for marking up blog [[posts]] on web sites. It can also be used to mark-up any other episodic or time series based content.

== Using h-entry ==
Use h-entry to markup:
* [[posts]], including:
** [[notes]]
** [[articles]]
** [[comments]]
** ... and all other post types

h-entries will typically be used in two places: alone on [[post]] permalink pages and in plural on [[feed]] pages. On post permalink pages they should be a top-level microformat (not nested under anything). On feed pages they may also be children of a [[h-feed]] if you wish to add feed-level data like feed name, author.

=== How to consume h-entry ===
* To find the author of a h-entry, use the [[authorship]] algorithm.
* To consume a feed of h-entries, look for multiple top-level h-entries or h-entry children of a top-level h-feed.
** If h-entries in a h-feed have no author property, look for an author on the h-feed. to do: add this to the authorship algorithm if it doesnâ€™t already cover it --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Waterpigs.co.uk]] 18:05, 24 October 2013 (PDT)
* To consume a single h-entry, look for the first h-entry on the page.

To do: add examples of common tasks required when parsing h-entries, based on real world experience.

== Why ==
Adding h-entry to your posts enables post information [[discovery]] on your permalinks, which is useful for a variety of things, including:
* [[reply]] context syndication
* syndication of your [[replies]] from your site as comments on the permalinks of the sites that you reply to.
* subscribing to your posts directly from your home page (no separate feed needed).

== What uses it ==
Numerous [[projects]] and sites are parsing and consuming h-entry for various purposes, including:
* [[reply-context]] - see in particular [[reply-context#IndieWeb_Examples|indieweb sites]] that show reply context information parsed from h-entry + [[h-card]]
* [[comment-presentation]] - e.g. see [[comment-presentation#Current_Indiewebcamp_Practices|indieweb sites]] that show comments on posts syndicated in via parsing h-entry from others' reply posts.
In short, [[h-entry]] is <em>the</em> key building block for the indieweb. It represents a unit of content, to be syndicated, for a variety of use-cases.
