'''<dfn>[http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry h-entry]</dfn>''' is the [[microformats2]] vocabulary for marking up blog [[posts]] on web sites. It can also be used to mark-up any other episodic or time series based content.

== Using h-entry ==
Use h-entry to markup:
* [[posts]], including:
** [[notes]]
** [[articles]]
** [[comments]]
** ... and all other post types

h-entries will typically be used in two places: alone on [[post]] permalink pages and in plural on [[feed]] pages. On post permalink pages they should be a top-level microformat (not nested under anything). On feed pages they may also be children of a [[h-feed]] if you wish to add feed-level data like feed name, author.

=== How to consume h-entry ===
For how to consume feeds of multiple h-entry posts, see [[feed#How_To_Consume|How To Consume Feeds]].

To consume a single h-entry:
* look for the first h-entry on the page. If none are found, this page does not represent a post.

For each h-entry, regardless of whether they’re being treated as a single post or part of a feed:
* to find the author of the h-entry, use the [[authorship]] algorithm
* to determine how to display the post as a comment, use the [[comment-presentation#How_to_display|comment presentation]] algorithm
* to determine the published datetime:
** if the h-entry has a <var>published</var> or <var>updated</var> property which is a valid datetime
*** if the datetime is floating (i.e. has no timezone), use the [[datetime#implying_timezone_from_webmentions implied timezone]] heuristic to determine the timezone
** if the fixed published datetime is in the future, cap it to the present
*** you may wish to preserve the source timezone in the derived time, and optionally also allow a small window within which “future” posts are accepted e.g. 10 minutes
** if there was no datetime, let the published datetime of the post be the datetime it was first seen

When notified of an update to a h-entry, either by [[webmention]] or [[PuSH]] or any other plumbing:
* optionally archive current status of 
* update the <var>updated</var> property to be the updated date of the post using the same datetime resolving process given above
* re-apply the above per-h-entry algorithm, ignoring any updates to the <var>published</var>

See also the processes documented on [[comment]] for handling incoming comments, updates and deletions.

==== Issues ====
* Many of the processes documented on [[comment]] (e.g. deletion) can be applied equally to other cases of h-entry consumption (e.g. in a reader), and some of the detail given here applies to comments processing (e.g. datetime processing). Anything which is applicable to general h-entry processing should be moved here, leaving only anything ''specific'' to the comment use-case on [[comment]], and these algorithm referred to from there --[[User:Waterpigs.co.uk|Barnaby Walters]] 05:33, 9 June 2014 (PDT)
*  …add issues with h-entry consumption to be resolved here.

== Why ==
Adding h-entry to your posts enables post information [[discovery]] on your permalinks, which is useful for a variety of things, including:
* [[reply]] context syndication
* syndication of your [[replies]] from your site as comments on the permalinks of the sites that you reply to.
* subscribing to your posts directly from your home page (no separate feed needed).

== What uses it ==
Numerous [[projects]] and sites are parsing and consuming h-entry for various purposes, including:
* [[reply-context]] - see in particular [[reply-context#IndieWeb_Examples|indieweb sites]] that show reply context information parsed from h-entry + [[h-card]]
* [[comment-presentation]] - e.g. see [[comment-presentation#Current_Indiewebcamp_Practices|indieweb sites]] that show comments on posts syndicated in via parsing h-entry from others' reply posts.
In short, [[h-entry]] is <em>the</em> key building block for the indieweb. It represents a unit of content, to be syndicated, for a variety of use-cases.
